Feature: QuantaTissu Model Inference

  Scenario: Predict the next token
    Given a trained QuantaTissu model
    And a prompt "hello"
    When I ask the model to predict the next token
    Then the model should return a single token ID

  Scenario: Generate a sequence of tokens
    Given a trained QuantaTissu model
    And a prompt "this is"
    When I ask the model to generate a sequence of 3 tokens
    Then the model should return a sequence of 3 token IDs

  Scenario: Generate a token with top_k sampling
    Given a trained QuantaTissu model
    And a prompt "this is a"
    When I ask the model to predict the next token with top_k sampling and k=5
    Then the model should return a single token ID

  Scenario: Generate a token with knowledge base context
    Given a trained QuantaTissu model
    And the knowledge base contains the document "this is a test"
    When I ask the model to predict the next token with the prompt "test"
    Then the model should return a single token ID

  Scenario: Generate a token with nucleus sampling
    Given a trained QuantaTissu model
    And a prompt "this is a"
    When I ask the model to predict the next token with nucleus sampling and p=0.9
    Then the model should return a single token ID

# TissDB JDBC/ODBC Connector

This directory will contain the source code and documentation for the official TissDB JDBC and ODBC connectors.

## Purpose

The JDBC/ODBC connectors will enable TissDB to integrate with a wide range of business intelligence (BI) tools, reporting frameworks, and data analytics platforms that rely on these standard database connectivity interfaces.

## Planned Features

-   **JDBC Driver:** A Java-based driver implementing the JDBC API for Java applications.
-   **ODBC Driver:** A C/C++ based driver implementing the ODBC API for various applications and operating systems.
-   **SQL Translation:** Translation layer to convert standard SQL queries from BI tools into TissQL (or the full SQL subset supported by TissDB).
-   **Metadata Retrieval:** Ability to expose TissDB schema (tables, columns, data types) to BI tools.
-   **Connection Pooling:** Efficient management of database connections.
-   **Authentication & Authorization:** Integration with TissDB's security model.

## Development Status

**Conceptual Stage:** This is a placeholder for future development. No code has been implemented yet.

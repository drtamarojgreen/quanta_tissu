# 100 Enhancements for the Sinew Web Application (TissDB API)

This document lists 100 potential enhancements for the Sinew web application, which is the RESTful API for the TissDB database. These enhancements are designed to be implementable without requiring additional external libraries or frameworks, focusing on improving the existing C++ implementation.

---

### 1. API Feature Enhancements

1.  **Bulk Operations:** Implement endpoints for bulk document insertion, update, and deletion in a single request (e.g., `POST /<collection>/_bulk`).
2.  **Pagination for `_all`:** Add support for cursor-based or offset-based pagination to the `GET /<collection>/_all` endpoint to handle large datasets.
3.  **Advanced Querying:** Extend the `POST /<collection>/_query` endpoint to support more complex queries (e.g., `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` operators).
4.  **Sorting Results:** Allow specifying sort order (ascending/descending) for query results based on one or more fields.
5.  **Field Projection:** Allow clients to specify which fields to include or exclude in the query response to reduce payload size.
6.  **Full-Text Search:** Implement a basic full-text search capability on string fields within a collection.
7.  **Partial Updates:** Support `PATCH` requests to allow partial updates of a document without sending the entire document.
8.  **Conditional Updates:** Allow updates only if a document meets certain conditions (e.g., `update if version == x`).
9.  **Collection-Level Metadata:** Add an endpoint to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata for a collection (e.g., `GET /<collection>/_meta`).
10. **API Versioning:** Introduce API versioning in the URL (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) to allow for future non-breaking changes.
11. **ETag Support:** Implement ETag headers for caching and conditional requests to avoid unnecessary data transfer.
12. **CORS Support:** Add support for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers to allow the API to be called from web browsers on different domains.
13. **Content Negotiation:** Support different response formats (e.g., JSON, XML) through `Accept` headers.
14. **`_count` Endpoint:** Add a `GET /<collection>/_count` endpoint to get the number of documents in a collection.
15. **Sub-document API:** Allow getting or setting parts of a JSON document (e.g., `GET /<collection>/<id>/path/to/field`).
16. **Geo-spatial Queries:** Add basic support for geospatial queries (e.g., find documents within a certain radius).
17. **Schema Discovery:** An endpoint to retrieve the schema of a collection (`GET /<collection>/_schema`).
18. **Index Management:** Endpoints to list (`GET /<collection>/_indexes`) and delete (`DELETE /<collection>/_indexes/<name>`) indexes.
19. **Atomic Increment/Decrement:** Add an operation to atomically increment or decrement a numeric field.
20. **Server Statistics:** An endpoint (`GET /_stats`) to provide server statistics (e.g., uptime, memory usage, number of requests).

### 2. Server Implementation Improvements

21. **Robust HTTP Parsing:** Replace the simplified HTTP request parsing with a more robust implementation that correctly handles headers, chunked encoding, and edge cases.
22. **Connection Keep-Alive:** Implement HTTP Keep-Alive to reuse TCP connections for multiple requests from the same client.
23. **Proper Thread Pool:** Use a fixed-size thread pool for handling client requests to avoid creating a new thread for every connection.
24. **Graceful Shutdown:** Ensure a graceful shutdown process that allows existing requests to complete before closing the server.
25. **Signal Handling:** Implement proper handling of signals (e.g., `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`) for graceful shutdown.
26. **Configuration File:** Allow configuring the server (e.g., port, thread pool size) through a configuration file instead of hardcoded values.
27. **Windows Service / Linux Daemon:** Add support for running the server as a background service or daemon.
28. **Request Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for requests to prevent long-running queries from blocking server resources.
29. **Response Compression:** Add support for response compression (e.g., Gzip) to reduce network bandwidth.
30. **Non-blocking I/O:** Refactor the networking layer to use non-blocking I/O (e.g., with `epoll` on Linux or `IOCP` on Windows) for better scalability.
31. **Custom Error Pages:** Allow for custom error pages or more detailed JSON error responses.
32. **Static File Serving:** Add the capability to serve static files (e.g., for a web-based admin interface).
33. **Request Body Size Limit:** Implement a configurable limit on the size of the request body to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
34. **Header Parsing:** Fully parse and store all HTTP headers from the request.
35. **Multipart Form Data:** Add support for parsing multipart/form-data, which is useful for file uploads.
36. **URL Encoding:** Properly handle URL-encoded characters in the path and query string.
37. **Character Set Handling:** Explicitly handle character sets (e.g., UTF-8) in requests and responses.
38. **Sandboxing:** Run the server in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
39. **Memory Management:** Improve memory management to reduce fragmentation and leaks.
40. **Refactor Routing:** Create a more flexible routing system that can be easily extended with new endpoints.

### 3. Security Enhancements

41. **Authentication:** Implement a basic authentication mechanism (e.g., API keys, Basic Auth).
42. **Authorization:** Add a role-based access control (RBAC) system to restrict access to certain endpoints or collections.
43. **HTTPS/TLS Support:** Add support for HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and the server.
44. **Input Validation:** Implement stricter input validation for all user-provided data (e.g., headers, body, query parameters).
45. **SQL Injection Prevention:** Sanitize all inputs used in queries to prevent injection attacks (even for NoSQL).
46. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
47. **Security Headers:** Add security-related HTTP headers to responses (e.g., `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`).
48. **Audit Logging:** Log all security-sensitive events (e.g., authentication failures, administrative actions).
49. **Disable Directory Listing:** Ensure that the server does not allow directory listing if static file serving is implemented.
50. **Protect Against Timing Attacks:** Use constant-time comparison for secrets like API keys.

### 4. Developer Experience Improvements

51. **Interactive API Documentation:** Generate interactive API documentation (like Swagger/OpenAPI) from the source code comments or a spec file.
52. **Clearer Error Messages:** Provide more descriptive and useful error messages in JSON format.
53. **Request ID:** Assign a unique ID to each request and include it in the response headers and logs for easier debugging.
54. **Example Code Snippets:** Provide example code snippets in different languages in the documentation.
55. **Docker Image:** Create a Docker image for easier deployment and development setup.
56. **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Build a simple CLI tool for interacting with the database API.
57. **Pretty Printing:** Add a `?pretty=true` query parameter to format the JSON response with indentation for readability.
58. **Verbose Logging:** Add a verbose logging mode for debugging purposes.
59. **Dry Run Mode:** Implement a "dry run" mode for write operations that validates the request without committing changes.
60. **Client Libraries:** Develop official client libraries for popular languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) that wrap the REST API.

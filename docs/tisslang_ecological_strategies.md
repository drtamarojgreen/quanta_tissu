# TissLang and Ecological Computing

TissLang is not just a language for instructing an AI agent; it is also a tool for promoting environmentally conscious computing. By making computational and environmental costs a first-class citizen in the language, TissLang aims to empower developers and AI agents to make greener software development choices.

This document outlines the key strategies for how TissLang can be used to support this vision.

## 1. Modeling and Estimating Environmental Cost

The first step towards building greener software is to understand its environmental cost. TissLang will provide mechanisms to model and estimate the cost of a given task before it is even executed.

### `ESTIMATE_COST` Blocks

The `ESTIMATE_COST` block is a key feature of this strategy. It allows the agent to perform a "dry run" of a task to estimate its resource consumption.

```tiss
ESTIMATE_COST {
  TASK "Refactor the user authentication module"
  STEP "Analyze the existing code" {
    RUN "pmd -d ./src -R rulesets/java/quickstart.xml -f text"
  }
  STEP "Generate a new implementation" {
    # This step would be a call to the model, which has a known cost
  }
}
```

The agent would then use its internal models to estimate the cost of this task in terms of:
-   **CPU-seconds**: The amount of CPU time required to complete the task.
-   **Memory-hours**: The amount of memory consumed over the duration of the task.
-   **API Calls**: The number of calls to external services, such as the underlying LLM.
-   **CO2e Score**: An estimated carbon footprint for the task, based on the energy consumption of the hardware and the carbon intensity of the grid.

## 2. Constraining and Budgeting Resource Usage

Once the cost of a task can be estimated, the next step is to control it. TissLang will provide constructs for setting explicit resource budgets and for asserting that those budgets are not exceeded.

### `SET_BUDGET` and `ASSERT COST`

The `SET_BUDGET` command allows a developer to set hard limits on the resources that can be consumed by a task. The `ASSERT COST` command can then be used to verify that the actual cost of a step or task stays within the budget.

```tiss
# Set a budget for the entire task
SET_BUDGET API_CALLS = 10
SET_BUDGET EXECUTION_TIME = "5m"

TASK "Optimize the database query"
STEP "Analyze the query plan" {
  RUN "EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE ..."
}
STEP "Rewrite the query" {
  # ... agent generates a new query ...
  ASSERT COST < 2 # Asserts that the number of API calls is less than 2
}
```

If an `ASSERT COST` statement fails, the agent can be instructed to try a different approach or to seek human intervention.

## 3. Green-Aware Planning and Decision-Making

By combining cost estimation and budgeting, TissLang enables the agent to engage in "green-aware" planning. When faced with multiple ways to accomplish a task, the agent can choose the one with the lowest environmental impact.

### Agent-Driven Optimization

The agent can be prompted to find the most efficient solution, not just in terms of performance but also in terms of environmental cost.

```tiss
TASK "Find the most computationally efficient way to sort a large dataset"
CHOOSE {
  OPTION "Use a memory-intensive quicksort algorithm" {
    ESTIMATE_COST { ... }
  }
  OPTION "Use a slower, but more memory-efficient, merge sort algorithm" {
    ESTIMATE_cost { ... }
  }
}
```

The agent would then evaluate the cost of each option and choose the one that best fits the given constraints.

## 4. Human-in-the-Loop Collaboration

Ultimately, making environmentally conscious trade-offs requires human judgment. TissLang will facilitate this by providing mechanisms for the agent to seek human input when faced with difficult decisions.

### The `REQUEST_REVIEW` Command

The `REQUEST_REVIEW` command can be used to pause execution and ask for human guidance.

```tiss
REQUEST_REVIEW "The proposed solution is fast but will require a more powerful server. An alternative solution is slower but can run on existing hardware. Which do you prefer?"
```

This allows the developer to make the final call on whether to prioritize performance or environmental impact.

By integrating these features into TissLang, we can create a powerful tool for building a more sustainable software ecosystem.

# TissDB Integration Strategy

## Introduction

TissDB is a purpose-built database designed to serve as a high-performance, flexible data backbone for the Quanta ecosystem. It utilizes a hybrid storage model supporting both **compressed XML** for complex, hierarchical documents and **CSV-style formats** for efficient, tabular knowledge storage.

Its core design features a two-layer storage method:
1.  An **unsecured, open knowledge layer** for sharing and integrating non-sensitive data between agents and services.
2.  A planned **secure, transactional layer** for robust, permissioned data management (to be developed later).

By combining a powerful query language (TissQL) with a novel graph-based algorithmic approach, TissDB aims to reduce data silos, simplify inter-service communication, and accelerate development cycles.

## Key Features Facilitating Integration

*   **Hybrid Data Storage:** TissDB's ability to natively handle both structured XML and tabular CSV allows services to use the best format for the job. Complex entities can be modeled in XML, while large datasets for knowledge harvesting can be efficiently stored and accessed as CSV, all within the same database.

*   **Graph-Powered TissQL Queries:** All data interactions are handled through TissQL. The query engine is built on algorithms that treat all data—whether from XML or CSV—as nodes in a 3D graph network. This allows for powerful, expressive queries that can traverse relationships between disparate data sources seamlessly.

*   **API-First Design:** TissDB is built with an API-first philosophy. All database features are exposed through a clean, well-documented RESTful API, making it easy for services written in any language or framework to connect and interact with the database.

*   **Layered Security Model:** The initial integration focuses on the unsecured knowledge layer, enabling rapid development and data sharing. This provides a "low-friction" environment for agents to collaborate. A future secure layer will add robust authentication and authorization for sensitive workloads.

## Integration Benefits

Adopting TissDB as a central data layer provides several key benefits for integrating services from different repositories:

1.  **Unified Data Access:** Services no longer need to implement bespoke clients or adapters to communicate with each other's data stores. They all communicate with a single, unified TissDB API.

3.  **Simplified Data Transformation:** TissQL can include built-in functions for transforming data into the specific formats required by different consumer services. This offloads complex data transformation logic from the application layer to the database layer.

4.  **Reduced Boilerplate Code:** By leveraging the expressive power of TissQL, developers can write less data access and manipulation code within their services, leading to cleaner, more focused application logic.

## Storage Architecture and Graph Algorithms

Conceptually, all data in TissDB is part of a unified graph.

*   **Nodes**: An XML document, or a row within a CSV file, is treated as a "node" in the graph.
*   **Edges**: Relationships, or "bonds," can be explicitly defined between nodes. This allows TissQL to traverse from a user document (XML) to their activity log (CSV), for example.

This architecture allows the query engine to perform complex joins and graph traversals that are not possible in traditional databases without significant effort. The algorithms are inspired by 3D network graphs, enabling queries that can find not just direct relationships, but also second- and third-order connections between data points.

## TissQL by Example

Consider two services in separate repositories: a `user-service` and a `product-service`.

*   The `user-service` is responsible for managing user profiles, preferences, and authentication. It stores all user data in TissDB.
*   The `product-service` is responsible for managing the product catalog and providing recommendations.

To personalize product recommendations, the `product-service` needs access to user preferences. Instead of creating a direct API dependency on the `user-service`, it can directly query TissDB using TissQL.

### Example 1: Basic Query on XML Data
// Retrieve preferences from a 'users' collection (stored as XML)
{
  "query": "SELECT preferences FROM users WHERE id = '12345'"
}

### Example 2: Aggregation on CSV Data
// Count how many times a user has viewed a product from a 'view_events' collection (stored as CSV)
{
  "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM view_events WHERE user_id = '12345' AND event_type = 'product_view'"
}

### Example 3: Graph Traversal (Joining XML and CSV)
// Find product names that a user has viewed more than 5 times.
// This query traverses from the 'users' collection to the 'view_events' collection.
{
  "query": "SELECT T2.product_name, COUNT(T2.product_name) as views FROM users T1 JOIN view_events T2 ON T1.id = T2.user_id WHERE T1.id = '12345' GROUP BY T2.product_name HAVING views > 5"
}

### Example 4: Finding Second-Order Connections
// Find other users who have purchased the same products as user '12345'
{
  "query": "SELECT T2.user_id FROM purchase_history T1 JOIN purchase_history T2 ON T1.product_id = T2.product_id WHERE T1.user_id = '12345' AND T2.user_id != '12345'"
}

## Integration Patterns

Services can integrate with TissDB using several common patterns:

1.  **Direct API Integration:** The simplest pattern. A service performs direct CRUD operations on documents it owns. For example, the `user-service` would use `POST /users` to create a new user and `GET /users/<id>` to retrieve one.

2.  **Shared Data Hub (Asynchronous Communication):** Two or more services communicate asynchronously by reading and writing to a shared collection. For example, a `payment-service` could write a `payment_receipt` document to a `receipts` collection, which an `email-service` then reads to send a confirmation email. This decouples the services, as neither needs to be aware of the other's operational status.

3.  **Data Aggregation Layer:** A dedicated service can be created to act as an aggregator. It queries multiple collections (e.g., `users`, `orders`, `products`), performs complex joins or aggregations, and writes a new, enriched document to a separate collection (e.g., `analytics_dashboard_data`). This pre-computes complex views for read-heavy applications.

## Step-by-Step Integration Guide

This guide provides a practical walkthrough for integrating a new service with TissDB.

### 1. Define Your Data Contract
Before writing any code, identify the structure of the data your service will read or write. For example, a new `inventory-service` might define a `product` document like this:

```xml
<document id="product_123">
  <sku>HD-WIDGET-01</sku>
  <stock_level>150</stock_level>
  <warehouse_location>Aisle 4, Bay 2</warehouse_location>
  <last_updated>2023-11-05T14:30:00Z</last_updated>
</document>
```

### 2. Implement an API Client
Your service will need a client to communicate with the TissDB REST API. Here is a basic example in Python using an HTTP client library.

```python
import requests
import json

TISSDB_URL = "http://tissdb.internal:8080"
API_KEY = "your-secure-api-key"

def create_product(product_data):
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
    response = requests.post(f"{TISSDB_URL}/inventory", headers=headers, data=json.dumps(product_data))
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()

def find_low_stock_products(threshold):
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
    query = f"SELECT sku, stock_level FROM inventory WHERE stock_level < {threshold}"
    response = requests.post(f"{TISSDB_URL}/inventory/_query", headers=headers, json={"query": query})
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()
```

### 3. Handle API Responses and Errors
Be prepared to handle standard HTTP status codes:
-   **`200 OK`**: Successful `GET` or `_query` request.
-   **`201 Created`**: Successful `POST` request to create a document.
-   **`400 Bad Request`**: Your request body or TissQL query is malformed.
-   **`401 Unauthorized`**: Your API key is missing or invalid.
-   **`404 Not Found`**: The requested document or collection does not exist.
-   **`500 Internal Server Error`**: An error occurred on the TissDB server.

## Advanced Integration: Data Synchronization Strategies

For complex systems, it's often necessary to actively synchronize data between services. TissDB can support this through several patterns.

### 1. Change Data Capture (CDC) Streams
The most robust method for real-time synchronization. Services can subscribe to a dedicated change stream for a collection.

*   **How it works**: A service establishes a persistent connection to a TissDB endpoint like `GET /inventory/_changes`. TissDB streams every create, update, and delete event happening in the `inventory` collection to the client in real-time.
*   **Use Case**: A `reporting-service` needs an immediate, up-to-date copy of all `order` documents to maintain live analytics dashboards. It subscribes to the `orders` change stream and updates its own aggregates as events arrive.

### 2. Webhooks
A simpler, push-based alternative to CDC for services that only need to be notified of changes.

*   **How it works**: A service registers a webhook with TissDB, providing a URL and specifying a collection and event type (e.g., `document:created`). When a matching event occurs, TissDB sends an HTTP POST request to the registered URL with a payload describing the event.
*   **Use Case**: An `notification-service` registers a webhook for new documents in the `support_tickets` collection. When a new ticket is created, TissDB notifies the service, which then sends an email alert to the support team.

### 3. Batch Synchronization
Suitable for non-critical data where near real-time updates are not required.

*   **How it works**: A service runs a scheduled job (e.g., every hour) that executes a TissQL query to pull data modified since the last run. This typically involves querying against a timestamp field.
*   **Use Case**: A `recommendation-engine` updates its models once a day. It runs a nightly query like `SELECT * FROM user_activity WHERE timestamp > 'yesterdays_date'` to fetch all new user activity and retrain its models.

## Data Governance and Schema Management

While TissDB's schema flexibility is a key feature, in a multi-repository environment, establishing clear data contracts is crucial for system stability.

### 1. Shared Schema Repository
It is highly recommended to maintain a central, version-controlled repository (e.g., a Git repo) that holds the canonical schemas for all shared data collections.

*   **Example**: A `schemas/user.xml` file in a shared `quanta-contracts` repository would define the official structure of a `user` document. Any service that interacts with the `users` collection should refer to this contract.

### 2. Schema Evolution Strategy
Services must be able to evolve their data structures without breaking downstream consumers. The following strategies are recommended:

*   **Additive Changes Only**: The most common and safest strategy. Never remove or rename fields that other services might be using. Only add new, optional fields. This ensures that older clients who are unaware of the new fields will not break.
*   **Document Versioning**: For significant, breaking changes, introduce a version number directly in the document.

    ```xml
    <document id="user_456">
      <schema_version>2.0</schema_version>
      <name>
        <first>Jane</first>
        <last>Doe</last>
      </name>
      ...
    </document>
    ```
    This allows consumer services to identify the document version and apply the correct parsing and handling logic, enabling multiple versions of a schema to coexist within the same collection.

## Security and Authentication

All communication with TissDB must be secured.

*   **Encryption in Transit**: The API requires TLS 1.2+ for all connections.
*   **Authentication**: Services must authenticate using a bearer token (API Key) in the `Authorization` header of every request.
*   **Authorization**: Access is controlled via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Roles are defined with granular permissions (e.g., `read`, `write`, `delete`) on a per-collection basis. Ensure your service's API key is associated with a role that has the minimum required permissions.

## Best Practices for Integration

To ensure a stable, scalable, and maintainable integration, please adhere to the following best practices.

### Performance Optimization
*   **Use Indexes**: For any field that will be used in a `WHERE` clause for queries, ensure an index is created. Querying non-indexed fields will result in a full collection scan, which is significantly slower.
*   **Be Specific with Projections**: Always specify the exact fields you need in a `SELECT` statement (e.g., `SELECT sku, stock_level` instead of `SELECT *`). This reduces the amount of data transferred over the network and the processing load on both the client and server.
*   **Batch Your Operations**: When creating or updating many documents, use the bulk endpoints (e.g., `bulk_create_documents`) instead of sending hundreds of individual requests. This significantly reduces network overhead and allows the database to perform more efficient writes.
*   **Cache Frequently Accessed Data**: If your service repeatedly fetches the same static or slowly changing data, implement a caching layer (e.g., Redis, Memcached, or a simple in-memory cache) on the client side to reduce load on TissDB.

### API Versioning
The TissDB API will follow a versioning scheme to manage changes and ensure client stability.

*   **Non-Breaking Changes**: Adding new, optional fields to API responses or adding new API endpoints are considered non-breaking changes and will not result in a version bump. Clients should be designed to ignore unexpected fields in JSON responses.
*   **Breaking Changes**: Any change that removes a field, renames a field, or alters the fundamental behavior of an existing endpoint is a breaking change. These changes will only be introduced in a new version of the API.
*   **Versioning Scheme**: The API will be versioned via the URL path (e.g., `/api/v1/users`, `/api/v2/users`). We are committed to maintaining older versions for a reasonable deprecation period to allow clients to migrate gracefully.

### Using Client Libraries
While it is possible to interact with TissDB via direct HTTP requests, it is highly recommended to use the official client libraries once they become available (see Phase 3 of the development plan).

*   **Benefits**: Client libraries will handle the complexities of authentication, request serialization, response parsing, and error handling, leading to cleaner and more reliable application code.

## Monitoring and Observability

To ensure the health and performance of TissDB and its integrations, it is essential to monitor key metrics. TissDB exposes a dedicated endpoint for this purpose.

*   **Metrics Endpoint**: TissDB provides a Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint at `GET /metrics`. This endpoint exposes real-time data on:
    *   **Query Performance**: Latency percentiles (p50, p90, p99) for read and write queries.
    *   **Throughput**: The number of read/write operations per second.
    *   **Error Rates**: The rate of HTTP 4xx and 5xx errors.
    *   **Resource Usage**: CPU load, memory usage, and disk space utilization.
*   **Structured Logging**: TissDB outputs structured logs (in JSON format) that can be ingested by log management systems like Splunk, Elasticsearch, or Loki. These logs provide detailed context for debugging failed queries or performance issues.
*   **Distributed Tracing**: For services integrating with TissDB, it is recommended to use distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry). TissDB is designed to propagate trace contexts, allowing you to visualize the entire lifecycle of a request as it flows from your service to the database and back.

## Backup and Recovery

A robust backup and recovery strategy is critical for data durability. TissDB provides mechanisms for creating consistent snapshots of the database.

### Backup Strategy
*   **Online Snapshots**: The recommended approach is to take regular online snapshots. A snapshot captures a consistent, point-in-time view of the entire database without requiring downtime.
*   **API Endpoint**: Snapshots can be triggered via an administrative API call:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://tissdb.internal:8080/_admin/snapshots -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_api_key>"
    ```
*   **Automation**: It is recommended to automate this process using a cron job or a scheduled task that triggers the snapshot and copies the resulting artifact to a secure, off-site storage location (e.g., an S3 bucket).

### Recovery Process
*   **Restoring from a Snapshot**: In the event of data loss or corruption, TissDB can be restored from a snapshot. This involves stopping the TissDB service, replacing the data directory with the contents of the snapshot, and restarting the service.
*   **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**: For more granular recovery, TissDB's Write-Ahead Log (WAL) can be used in conjunction with a snapshot to restore the database to a specific point in time. This is an advanced procedure detailed in the TissDB administration guide.

## Analytics and Reporting Capabilities

Beyond serving as a transactional database, TissDB is designed with powerful features to support analytical queries and business intelligence reporting directly on your operational data.

### 1. Advanced Analytical Queries
TissQL's support for aggregations, joins, and window functions makes it a powerful tool for data analysis. You can perform complex calculations directly within the database, reducing the need to move large amounts of data to a separate analytics system.

**Example: Monthly Sales Report (Join & Aggregation)**
This query joins `orders` with `products` to calculate total revenue per product category.

```json
// POST /_query
{
  "query": "SELECT p.category, SUM(o.quantity * p.price) AS total_revenue FROM orders o JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id WHERE o.order_date >= '2023-10-01' AND o.order_date < '2023-11-01' GROUP BY p.category ORDER BY total_revenue DESC"
}
```

### 1.1. Time-Series and Window Functions
TissQL also supports window functions, which are essential for time-series analysis. These functions allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows that are related to the current row.

**Example: 7-Day Moving Average of Sales**
This query calculates the 7-day moving average of total sales from a `daily_sales` collection.

```json
// POST /_query
{
  "query": "SELECT sale_date, total_sales, AVG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS seven_day_moving_avg FROM daily_sales"
}
```

### 2. Materialized Views for Performance
For frequently run, complex analytical queries, TissDB supports **materialized views**. A materialized view pre-computes and stores the result of a query, allowing for near-instantaneous access to complex aggregations.

*   **How it works**: You define a materialized view using a standard TissQL `SELECT` query. TissDB runs this query periodically in the background and stores the results in a special, read-only collection.
*   **API Endpoint**:
    ```bash
    # Create or update a materialized view
    curl -X PUT http://tissdb.internal:8080/_views/monthly_sales_by_category \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_api_key>" \
         -d '{
               "query": "SELECT p.category, ...",
               "refresh_interval": "24h"
             }'
    ```
*   **Use Case**: A business dashboard needs to display monthly sales figures. Instead of running the expensive join query every time the dashboard loads, it can simply query the `monthly_sales_by_category` materialized view for instant results.

### 3. Integration with Business Intelligence (BI) Tools
TissDB is designed to integrate with standard BI and data visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Metabase.

*   **TissDB Connector**: A dedicated JDBC/ODBC connector will be provided, allowing BI tools to connect to TissDB as they would to a traditional SQL database. The connector translates the BI tool's queries into TissQL.
*   **REST API for Analytics**: For tools that can consume REST APIs, TissDB provides a simple way to fetch query results in standard formats.
    ```bash
    # Request data as CSV for easy import into analytics tools
    curl -X POST http://tissdb.internal:8080/orders/_query \
         -H "Accept: text/csv" \
         -d '{"query": "SELECT id, order_date, total_amount FROM orders"}'
    ```

### 4. Scheduled Reporting
You can build automated reporting services on top of TissDB.

*   **How it works**: A scheduled service (e.g., a Python script running on a cron job) periodically executes a TissQL query against the API. The service then formats the results into a report (e.g., a PDF, an Excel file, or an email body) and distributes it to stakeholders.
*   **Use Case**: A daily report of new user sign-ups is automatically generated and emailed to the marketing team every morning at 8 AM.

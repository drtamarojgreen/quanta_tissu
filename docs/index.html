            <h2>About QuantaTissu</h2>
            <p>QuantaTissu is a minimal transformer-based language model inference engine built from scratch in Python using only NumPy. It serves as an educational tool to understand the inner workings of a transformer model and as the foundational first step towards building a sophisticated, agentic coding assistant.</p>

            <h2>TissLang: The Agentic Language</h2>
            <p>TissLang is a high-level, declarative language designed specifically for orchestrating agentic workflows. It allows developers to define complex tasks in a structured, human-readable format, breaking down high-level goals into sequential steps with commands and assertions to verify outcomes.</p>

            <h2>TissDB: A High-Performance NoSQL Database</h2>
            <p>TissDB is a lightweight, high-performance NoSQL database built from scratch in C++. It features a log-structured merge-tree (LSM-Tree) for high write throughput, a flexible JSON-like document model, and a simple SQL-like query language called TissQL.</p>

            <h2>Tissu Sinew: C++ Connector for TissDB</h2>
            <p>Tissu Sinew is a lightweight, high-performance C++ connector for TissDB. It provides a native, thread-safe C++ interface for applications to communicate with the database server, featuring connection pooling and a clean, modern C++ API.</p>

        <section id="ecology">
            <h2>Ecological Awareness</h2>
            <p>The QuantaTissu project aims to be a demonstration of how AI can be developed and used in an environmentally conscious manner. This involves optimizing the model for lower energy consumption, generating more energy-efficient code, and having the AI agent reflect on the environmental impact of its work.</p>

# Test Status Report

This report provides a detailed overview of the current test status of the QuantaTissu repository, covering both the Python-based language model and the C++ database components.

## 1. Python Test Status (`QuantaTissu` LM)

The Python tests were executed, and the results are as follows:

### 1.1. Execution Summary

| Metric   | Count | Notes                                                               |
| :------- | :---- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Total**  | 53    | Total number of tests discovered by the test runner.                |
| **Passed** | 46    | Tests that ran successfully.                                        |
| **Failed** | 1     | `TestTissLangParser.test_parse_write` in `test_tisslang_parser.py`. |
| **Skipped**| 6     | All skipped tests are for the `ExecutionEngine`, which is not yet implemented. |

The single test failure is due to a minor bug in the TissLang parser's handling of whitespace in multiline `WRITE` commands.

### 1.2. Code Coverage

The overall code coverage for the Python modules is **32%**.

#### Coverage Breakdown:

*   **Well-Covered Modules (>60%):**
    *   `knowledge_base.py`: 100%
    *   `tisslang_parser.py`: 88%
    *   `tokenizer.py`: 84%
    *   `model.py`: 78%
    *   `layers.py`: 63%

*   **Poorly-Covered or Untested Modules (<25%):**
    *   `execution_engine.py`: 21% (and all tests are currently skipped)
    *   **Modules with 0% coverage:** `bpe_trainer.py`, `data.py`, `demo.py`, `enhanced_demo.py`, `generate_text.py`, `loss.py`, `optimizer.py`, `run_inference.py`, `run_tiss.py`, `run_training.py`, `scheduler.py`, `tools.py`, `train.py`, `train_bpe.py`, `utils.py`.

### 1.3. Python Testing Gaps and Recommendations

1.  **Untested Training Pipeline:** The most significant gap is the complete lack of tests for the model training pipeline. All modules related to training, data handling, and optimization have 0% coverage. **Recommendation:** Add a suite of unit and integration tests for the training process.
2.  **Incomplete Feature Tests:** The `ExecutionEngine` for TissLang is not tested, as the feature is incomplete. **Recommendation:** As the execution engine is implemented, the corresponding tests should be enabled and expanded.

## 2. C++ Test Status (`TissDB` and `Tissu Sinew`)

Due to a "DO NOT COMPILE" constraint, the C++ tests could not be executed. The following analysis is based on a manual review of the test source code.

### 2.1. Overview

*   There are at least **27 C++ test files** located in the `tests/` and `tests/db/` directories.
*   The tests appear to be well-structured and cover multiple layers of the C++ codebase.

### 2.2. Qualitative Analysis

*   **Unit Tests:** Core data structures and components, such as the LSM-Tree storage engine, are tested in isolation. This is good practice and ensures that fundamental components are robust.
*   **Integration Tests:** The TissQL query executor is tested in conjunction with the parser and storage engine, verifying that the components work together correctly.
*   **Mocking:** The `Tissu Sinew` connector tests use a mock session object. This allows the connector's logic (e.g., parameter substitution, transaction management) to be tested without requiring a live database connection, which makes the tests faster and more reliable.

### 2.3. C++ Testing Gaps and Recommendations

1.  **Unknown Pass/Fail Status:** The most obvious gap is that the actual pass/fail status of these tests is unknown. **Recommendation:** Integrate the C++ build and test execution into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline. This will provide immediate feedback on the health of the C++ codebase.
2.  **Unknown Coverage:** Without running the tests, it is impossible to know the code coverage. **Recommendation:** A coverage report should be generated as part of the CI pipeline to identify any untested areas in the C++ code.

## 3. Overall Summary

The project has a solid foundation of tests for both its Python and C++ components. However, there are significant gaps that need to be addressed.

*   **Immediate Priority (Python):** The lack of tests for the ML training pipeline is a critical issue.
*   **Immediate Priority (C++):** The inability to run the C++ tests is a major blind spot. Setting up a CI environment to compile and run these tests is essential.

By addressing these gaps, the project can significantly improve its reliability and maintainability.

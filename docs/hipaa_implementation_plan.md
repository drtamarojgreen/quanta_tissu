# QuantaTissu Ecosystem - HIPAA Implementation Plan

This document outlines the necessary engineering tasks to make the entire QuantaTissu ecosystem compliant with the technical safeguards required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

This plan is a living document that will guide the development efforts. Each section outlines a specific component of the ecosystem, its deficiencies with respect to HIPAA, and the required remediation.

---

## Component: TissDB (C++ NoSQL Database)

### 1. Introduction

TissDB, in its current state, was not designed with the stringent security controls required for handling Protected Health Information (PHI). Achieving HIPAA compliance requires a comprehensive effort to remediate gaps in several key areas of the database architecture.

### 2. Core Compliance Pillars

The technical safeguards of the HIPAA Security Rule can be broken down into four core pillars. All of the proposed changes are designed to satisfy requirements within these domains:

1.  **Access Control**: Ensuring that only authorized persons and systems can access ePHI. This involves implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
2.  **Encryption**: Making ePHI unreadable, both when it is stored (at rest) and when it is being transmitted over a network (in transit).
3.  **Auditing & Logging**: Creating and maintaining a detailed, immutable record of all activities involving ePHI, including who accessed it, what they did, and when.
4.  **Data Integrity**: Protecting ePHI from improper alteration or destruction, and ensuring data is what it purports to be.

### 3. Pillar 1: Access Control

**Deficiency:** TissDB currently has no authentication or authorization layer. Any user with network access to the API endpoint can perform any action, including reading, writing, and deleting data.

**Remediation Plan:**

#### 3.1. API Token Authentication

A mandatory, token-based authentication system must be implemented for all API requests.

*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Generate and Manage API Tokens:** Create a secure, internal mechanism or a command-line utility to generate high-entropy API tokens. These tokens should be stored securely (e.g., hashed in a dedicated system collection).
    2.  **HTTP Header Requirement:** The `http_server` must be modified to require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for all incoming requests, except for a potential public-facing status endpoint.
    3.  **Token Validation:** Upon receiving a request, the server will validate the token against the stored hashes. Requests with missing or invalid tokens will be rejected with a `401 Unauthorized` status.

*   **Key Files to Modify:**
    *   `tissdb/api/http_server.cpp`: To inspect incoming requests for the `Authorization` header and trigger the validation logic.
    *   `tissdb/api/http_server.h`: To add new private methods for token handling.
    *   A new module for token generation and management will need to be created.

#### 3.2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Once a user is authenticated, their permissions must be checked. An RBAC system will be implemented to enforce the principle of least privilege.

*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Define Roles:** Create a set of predefined roles (e.g., `admin`, `read_write`, `read_only`).
    2.  **Associate Roles with Tokens:** Each API token will be associated with one or more roles.
    3.  **Enforce Permissions:** Before executing any operation (e.g., `DELETE /collection`, `POST /collection/_query`), the `http_server` or a dedicated authorization module must check if the token's roles grant permission for that action on that specific resource.
    4.  **Admin-Only Endpoints:** Critical operations like creating/deleting collections or managing users must be restricted to the `admin` role.

*   **Key Files to Modify:**
    *   `tissdb/api/http_server.cpp`: To integrate RBAC checks after successful authentication.
    *   `tissdb/query/executor.cpp`: Potentially, to enforce row-level or collection-level security during query execution.
    *   A new module for defining and managing roles and permissions will need to be created.

### 4. Pillar 2: Encryption

**Deficiency:** TissDB does not encrypt data, either in transit or at rest. All data is transmitted and stored in cleartext.

**Remediation Plan:**

#### 4.1. Encryption in Transit (HTTPS)

All API communication must be encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS).

*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Integrate a TLS Library:** The `http_server` must be modified to use a TLS-capable C++ HTTP library or to directly integrate a library like OpenSSL or Boost.Asio with TLS support.
    2.  **Certificate Management:** The server will need a mechanism to load and use SSL/TLS certificates (private key and public certificate). This should be configurable.
    3.  **Disable HTTP:** Once HTTPS is successfully implemented, the non-encrypted HTTP endpoint must be disabled entirely to prevent insecure communication.

*   **Key Files to Modify:**
    *   `tissdb/api/http_server.cpp`: This file will require significant changes to replace the underlying HTTP server implementation with a secure HTTPS server.
    *   `tissdb/main.cpp`: To handle the new server configuration, including certificate paths.

#### 4.2. Encryption at Rest

All data stored on disk, including data files (SSTables) and the Write-Ahead Log (WAL), must be encrypted.

*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Choose a Cryptographic Library:** Integrate a standard, well-vetted cryptographic library such as OpenSSL or libsodium.
    2.  **Key Management:** Implement a Key Management System (KMS). This could involve a master key that encrypts per-file or per-collection keys. The master key must be stored securely, ideally outside the database data directory (e.g., in a secure vault or provided at startup).
    3.  **Encrypt SSTables:** Before writing an SSTable to disk, the entire file buffer must be encrypted using an authenticated encryption mode like AES-256-GCM. The reverse decryption process must be applied when reading an SSTable.
    4.  **Encrypt WAL:** Similarly, all entries written to the WAL must be encrypted before being flushed to disk.

*   **Key Files to Modify:**
    *   `tissdb/storage/sstable.cpp`: The `write_from_memtable` and `merge` functions must be modified to call the encryption library before writing to the file stream. The `find` and `scan` functions will need to decrypt data after reading it.
    *   `tissdb/storage/wal.cpp`: The function that writes to the log file must encrypt the data first. The log replay function will need to decrypt it.
    *   A new module for Key Management will need to be created.

### 5. Pillar 3: Auditing and Logging

**Deficiency:** TissDB lacks a dedicated, security-focused audit logging mechanism. While some logging may exist for debugging, it is not sufficient to meet HIPAA's requirement for a comprehensive audit trail of all ePHI access.

**Remediation Plan:**

#### 5.1. Implement Comprehensive Audit Logging

A new, dedicated logging system must be created to record all relevant events.

*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Create a Secure Log Format:** Define a structured log format (e.g., JSON) that captures, at a minimum:
        *   Timestamp (UTC)
        *   Authenticated User/Token ID
        *   Source IP Address
        *   API Endpoint and HTTP Method
        *   Resource Accessed (e.g., collection name, document ID)
        *   Event Type (e.g., `DOC_READ`, `DOC_WRITE`, `COLLECTION_DELETE`, `AUTH_SUCCESS`, `AUTH_FAILURE`)
        *   Event Status (Success/Failure)
    2.  **Integrate Logging Calls:** Insert logging calls at critical points in the code before any data operation is executed.
    3.  **Append-Only, Immutable Logs:** Logs should be written to a dedicated file that is protected by file system permissions. The logging mechanism should only be able to append to this file, not modify or delete existing entries.

*   **Key Files to Modify:**
    *   `tissdb/api/http_server.cpp`: To log all incoming requests, authentication attempts, and authorization results.
    *   `tissdb/query/executor.cpp`: To log the details of specific data operations (read, write, delete).
    *   A new `AuditLogger` module will need to be created to handle log formatting and writing.

#### 5.2. Secure Log Access API

Administrators must be able to review the audit logs. A secure, admin-only API endpoint will be created for this purpose.

*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Create a New Endpoint:** Add a new endpoint, such as `GET /_admin/audit_log`.
    2.  **RBAC Protection:** This endpoint must be protected by the RBAC system and should only be accessible to users with the `admin` role.
    3.  **Query Capabilities:** The endpoint should support basic filtering capabilities, such as by date range, user ID, or event type.

*   **Key Files to Modify:**
    *   `tissdb/api/http_server.cpp`: To add the new endpoint and its associated logic.

### 6. Pillar 4: Data Integrity, Backup, and Disposal

**Deficiency:** While TissDB has basic checksums, it lacks a comprehensive data integrity strategy. Furthermore, there are no defined procedures for secure backup, restoration, or data disposal.

**Remediation Plan:**

#### 6.1. Data Integrity

The existing checksum mechanism will be enhanced by the authenticated encryption specified in the Encryption pillar.

*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Leverage Authenticated Encryption:** The use of an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) cipher mode like AES-256-GCM for encryption at rest will provide strong cryptographic guarantees of both confidentiality and integrity. This is superior to a simple checksum.
    2.  **Verify on Read:** Every time an encrypted block of data is read from disk (from an SSTable or WAL), the GCM authentication tag must be verified. A failed verification indicates data tampering and must be treated as a critical security event, preventing the data from being used.

*   **Key Files to Modify:**
    *   `tissdb/storage/sstable.cpp`: During decryption, the GCM tag must be verified.
    *   `tissdb/storage/wal.cpp`: During decryption, the GCM tag must be verified.

#### 6.2. Backup and Restoration

Formal procedures for creating and restoring secure, encrypted backups must be established.

*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Offline Backup Utility:** Develop a command-line utility that can safely create a point-in-time, offline backup of the database. The backup process will involve copying the encrypted SSTable and WAL files.
    2.  **Secure Restoration:** The same utility will provide a mechanism to restore a backup. This process must only be available to a privileged administrator.
    3.  **Documentation:** Clear documentation must be written for administrators, outlining the backup and restoration procedures.

#### 6.3. Data Disposal

When data is deleted, it must be rendered permanently unrecoverable.

*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Cryptographic Shredding:** Because all data is encrypted at rest, the most effective way to achieve secure disposal is through "cryptographic shredding." Instead of overwriting the physical disk sectors, the encryption keys associated with the data are securely and permanently deleted. Without the keys, the encrypted data is rendered useless garbage.
    2.  **Key Deletion:** The Key Management System must provide a secure method for destroying data encryption keys when a collection or the entire database is deleted.

## Component: QuantaTissu LM (Python Language Model)

The QuantaTissu Language Model and its associated tools (training, inference, knowledge base) can potentially process, store, or generate ePHI.

### 1. Pillar 1: Access Control

**Deficiency:** The current model loading and inference scripts (`run_inference.py`, `generate_text.py`) do not have an access control layer. If exposed via an API, there is no mechanism to control who can query the model.

**Remediation Plan:**
*   **API Wrapper with Authentication:** Any deployment of the LM as a service must be wrapped in a secure API gateway (e.g., a Flask or FastAPI application). This API must enforce the same token-based authentication and RBAC system defined for TissDB, ensuring that only authorized users can query the model.
*   **Secure Configuration:** Access to the model files and the knowledge base vector store on the file system must be restricted using standard file permissions to prevent unauthorized direct access.

*   **Key Files to Modify:**
    *   A new Python-based API server application will need to be created.
    *   `quanta_tissu/tisslm/core/knowledge_base.py`: To ensure it connects to TissDB (if used for storage) using the new secure, authenticated client.

### 2. Pillar 2: Encryption

**Deficiency:** The model's knowledge base, if stored on disk, is not encrypted. Any training data containing ePHI that is stored locally would also be in cleartext.

**Remediation Plan:**
*   **Encryption of Knowledge Base:** If the vector knowledge base is stored in TissDB, it will automatically be covered by TissDB's encryption-at-rest. If it is stored as flat files (e.g., FAISS index, NumPy arrays), these files must be encrypted using a strong, standard library like `cryptography` in Python. The encryption keys must be managed securely, similar to the TissDB Key Management System.
*   **Encryption of Training Data:** All training and fine-tuning data containing ePHI must be encrypted at rest. Access to this data during training should be via a data loader that decrypts data in-memory, just-in-time for use.
*   **Encryption in Transit:** When the model is accessed via the new secure API, communications will be protected by TLS/HTTPS.

*   **Key Files to Modify:**
    *   `quanta_tissu/tisslm/core/knowledge_base.py`: To add logic for encrypting/decrypting the knowledge base if it's stored in flat files.
    *   `quanta_tissu/tisslm/core/data.py`: The data loading pipeline will need to be modified to handle decryption of training files.

### 3. Pillar 3: Auditing and Logging

**Deficiency:** There is no audit trail for model predictions or knowledge base queries. It is not possible to track who queried the model or what information was retrieved or generated.

**Remediation Plan:**
*   **Comprehensive Audit Logging:** The API server wrapper must generate detailed audit logs for every query. The log format should be consistent with the TissDB logs and capture:
    *   Timestamp (UTC)
    *   Authenticated User/Token ID
    *   Source IP Address
    *   The full prompt or query sent to the model.
    *   The full response generated by the model.
    *   Any data retrieved from the knowledge base to satisfy the query.
    *   Event Type (e.g., `MODEL_INFERENCE`, `KB_QUERY`).
*   **Log Storage:** These logs should be sent to a secure, append-only storage system, potentially the same audit logging system used by TissDB if it's made accessible.

*   **Key Files to Modify:**
    *   The new Python-based API server will be responsible for generating all audit logs.

### 4. Pillar 4: Data Integrity and Disposal

**Deficiency:** There are no mechanisms to verify the integrity of the model files or knowledge base, nor are there procedures for securely disposing of PHI-containing models.

**Remediation Plan:**
*   **Model Integrity:** Checksums (e.g., SHA-256) of the model files and knowledge base should be generated and stored securely. These checksums should be verified on application startup to ensure the files have not been tampered with.
*   **Cryptographic Shredding:** When a model trained on ePHI or a knowledge base containing ePHI needs to be retired, the data must be made unrecoverable. This is achieved by securely deleting the encryption keys associated with the data (cryptographic shredding). Simply deleting the files is not sufficient.

## Component: Analytics Platform (Python)

The Analytics Platform is used for data analysis, charting, and modeling. It is a high-risk component as it may load large amounts of ePHI into memory for processing.

### 1. Pillar 1: Access Control

**Deficiency:** The platform's scripts run locally without a centralized access control mechanism. Access is controlled only by file system permissions.

**Remediation Plan:**
*   **Secure Database Connection:** The database connector (`db_connector.py`) must be updated to use the new secure TissDB client, which will enforce authentication and authorization for all database queries. The connector must be configured with a dedicated, role-limited API token.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** The API token used by the Analytics Platform should have the minimum necessary permissions (e.g., `read_only`) for its tasks. It should not use a full `admin` token.

*   **Key Files to Modify:**
    *   `analytics/platform/db_connector.py`: To be updated to support token-based authentication and HTTPS connections to TissDB.

### 2. Pillar 2: Encryption

**Deficiency:** The platform may load ePHI from the database and store it in intermediate, unencrypted formats (e.g., CSV files, Pandas DataFrames saved to disk).

**Remediation Plan:**
*   **No Unencrypted Persistence:** The platform must be prohibited from writing unencrypted ePHI to persistent storage. Any data that needs to be cached or stored temporarily on disk must be encrypted using a standard Python cryptography library.
*   **Secure Configuration:** Any configuration files that contain secrets, such as the TissDB API token, must themselves be encrypted or stored in a secure vault.

*   **Key Files to Modify:**
    *   `analytics/platform/main.py`: And other analysis scripts may need to be modified to include encryption when saving intermediate results.
    *   `analytics/platform/patterns.py`: If these patterns involve saving data, they must be updated.

### 3. Pillar 3: Auditing and Logging

**Deficiency:** While TissDB will audit the initial data query, there is no logging of what the Analytics Platform *does* with the data once it has been retrieved.

**Remediation Plan:**
*   **Analysis Run Logging:** Each execution of an analysis run that processes ePHI must be logged. The logs should capture:
    *   Timestamp (UTC).
    *   The user who initiated the run.
    *   The specific analysis script or pattern that was executed.
    *   The TissDB query that was used to fetch the data.
    *   A description of the output generated (e.g., "Chart created: patient_age_distribution.png", "Model trained: risk_prediction_model.pkl").
*   **Log Forwarding:** These logs must be forwarded to the central, secure audit logging system.

*   **Key Files to Modify:**
    *   A new logging module should be added to the analytics platform to standardize this process.
    *   `analytics/platform/main.py`: To be updated to call this new logging module.

### 4. Pillar 4: Data Integrity and Disposal

**Deficiency:** There are no formal procedures for managing the lifecycle of data within the Analytics Platform.

**Remediation Plan:**
*   **Output Management:** Any output artifacts (charts, reports, models) that contain or are derived from ePHI must be stored securely, ideally within an encrypted collection in TissDB itself.
*   **Data Disposal:** A clear data retention policy must be defined. Any temporary files or cached data containing ePHI must be securely deleted after an analysis run is complete. This means not just deleting the file, but using a secure shredding utility or relying on cryptographic shredding if the data was encrypted.

## Component: Nexus Flow, Tissu Sinew, and TissLang

These components are clients, connectors, or orchestrators. Their primary HIPAA requirement is to securely interact with the core data and AI services.

### 1. Nexus Flow (C++ Graph Visualization)

*   **Deficiency:** Connects to TissDB over an unencrypted channel. May cache data insecurely.
*   **Remediation Plan:**
    *   **Secure Connection:** Nexus Flow must use the `Tissu Sinew` connector, which will be updated to support HTTPS and token authentication.
    *   **No Persistent Caching of ePHI:** The application must not cache any ePHI on the local file system. All data should be fetched from TissDB on demand. If caching is absolutely required for performance, the cache must be encrypted.
    *   **Audit Logging:** User actions within Nexus Flow that trigger queries of ePHI in TissDB will be captured by the TissDB audit logs.

### 2. Tissu Sinew (C++ Connector)

*   **Deficiency:** The current connector does not support TLS/HTTPS or token authentication.
*   **Remediation Plan:**
    *   **Update Client Library:** The `Tissu Sinew` HTTP client must be updated to support TLS. It must also be modified to allow users to specify an API token that is sent with every request in the `Authorization` header. This is a critical dependency for all C++ components that need to communicate with the HIPAA-compliant TissDB.

### 3. TissLang (DSL)

*   **Deficiency:** The language itself has no concept of security. A developer could write a script that insecurely handles ePHI.
*   **Remediation Plan:**
    *   **Security is a Runtime Concern:** No changes are required for the language itself. Compliance is the responsibility of the script author and the execution engine.
    *   **Update Documentation and Examples:** All documentation and example `.tiss` scripts must be updated to demonstrate the correct, secure way to handle ePHI. This includes using secure, authenticated endpoints and not writing sensitive data to insecure locations.
    *   **Execution Engine Hardening:** The TissLang execution engine (`run_tiss.py`) must be configured to use secure clients for all its operations (e.g., connecting to TissDB or the LM API).

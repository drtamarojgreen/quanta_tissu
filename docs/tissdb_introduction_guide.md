# Introduction to TissDB

TissDB is a next-generation NoSQL database that serves as a flexible, high-performance data backbone for the Quanta ecosystem. It is an evolving project that combines a long-term, ambitious vision with a practical, phased implementation. This document provides a general introduction to its core concepts, current state, and future direction.

## The Vision: A Self-Organizing Data Tissue

The foundational vision for TissDB is rooted in the principles of **TissLang**, a paradigm that models data structures on the biological concept of living tissue. In this vision, TissDB is not merely a passive data store but a dynamic, resilient, and self-organizing system.

Key principles of this vision include:
- **Cellular Data Atoms**: Data is encapsulated in self-contained "cells" that hold not only data but also metadata and logic.
- **Inter-Cellular Adhesion**: Cells form relationships through "adhesion bonds," creating complex, graph-like "tissues" that allow for organic data evolution.
- **Homeostasis and Adaptation**: The data tissue is designed to be self-healing and can adapt its structure over time in response to new data patterns.

This conceptual framework guides the long-term development of TissDB, aiming to create a database ideal for dynamic systems like social networks, IoT, and real-time collaborative platforms.

## Current Implementation: A C++ NoSQL Database

The current, functional implementation of TissDB is a lightweight, high-performance NoSQL database built in C++. It provides a solid foundation that is being actively developed toward the broader vision.

Its core features include:
- **Storage Engine**: A Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree) designed for high write throughput.
- **Data Model**: A flexible, JSON-like document model for storing data.
- **Collection Management**: Data is organized into named collections, similar to tables in a relational database.
- **Query Language**: TissQL, a simple, SQL-like query language for interacting with the data.
- **Indexing**: Support for B-Tree indexing to enable fast lookups.
- **API**: A RESTful API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents.

While the current implementation is a significant first step, it is still under active development and has known limitations, such as a lack of transaction support and a non-persistent B-Tree index.

## Development Roadmap

TissDB is being developed in a phased approach, bridging the gap between the current implementation and the long-term vision. The public development plan outlines several phases:

- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Focused on building the core single-node database, including the storage layer, collection management, the REST API, the TissQL parser, and basic indexing. This phase is largely complete.
- **Phase 2 (V1.1)**: Aims to add more robust features like LSM-tree compaction, expanded TissQL capabilities, compound indexing, and multi-document transactions.
- **Phase 3 (V2.0)**: Intends to transform TissDB into a distributed system with leader-follower replication, sharding, and robust security features like RBAC and encryption.

## The Broader Ecosystem

It is important to note that the TissDB concept also informs other components within the Quanta repository. A related Python implementation, the `KnowledgeBase` class, serves as a functional, in-memory vector store for managing knowledge based on semantic similarity. While distinct from the C++ database, it implements some of the core ideas behind TissDB's intended knowledge management capabilities.

Together, these components—the visionary documents, the C++ implementation, and related Python modules—form the TissDB ecosystem.

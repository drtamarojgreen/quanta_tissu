# Applying TissLM for Agentic Coding

The `TissLM` framework can be extended beyond its role in the RAG pipeline to become a powerful partner in the software development process itself. By fine-tuning the model on this repository's codebase and development patterns, we can create a sophisticated "agentic coding" assistant.

## Proposed Capabilities

An agentic `TissLM` could be invoked via a dedicated script or tool to perform a variety of tasks:

### 1. Automated Code Scaffolding
Based on high-level descriptions found in the planning documents, the agent could generate initial boilerplate and scaffolding for new components.

*   **Example Prompt:** `tisslm-agent --task=scaffold --spec=docs/new_component_spec.md --output=src/new_component`
*   **Action:** The agent reads the specification document, which describes a new C++ class. It then generates `new_component.h` and `new_component.cpp` with the class definition, member variables, method stubs, and include guards already in place.

### 2. Intelligent Refactoring
The agent could analyze existing code and suggest improvements based on best practices, performance, or consistency with the rest of the codebase.

*   **Example Prompt:** `tisslm-agent --task=refactor --file=src/old_module.py`
*   **Action:** The agent analyzes `old_module.py` and might suggest refactoring a complex function into smaller, more manageable pieces, or propose a more efficient algorithm for a specific data manipulation task.

### 3. Automated Documentation and Test Generation
The agent can streamline the documentation and testing process, which are critical for maintainability.

*   **Documentation:** Given a source file, the agent could generate markdown documentation explaining the purpose of each class and function, its parameters, and its return values.
*   **Unit Tests:** For a given function, the agent could generate a set of unit tests, including edge cases, to ensure its correctness. It could analyze the code to identify boundary conditions that need testing.

# Visualization with the `multiple_viewer`

To complement the text-based conceptualization documents, a dedicated visualization tool, tentatively named `multiple_viewer`, is proposed. This tool would transform static markdown plans into rich, interactive diagrams.

## Proposed Features

The `multiple_viewer` would be a utility that can be run on the `docs/` directory to generate a visual, navigable representation of the project's architecture and plans.

### 1. Embedded Diagram Rendering
Many documents could be enhanced with embedded diagrams using a text-based format like Mermaid.js. The `multiple_viewer` would be responsible for parsing these documents and rendering the diagrams into viewable formats (e.g., SVG or PNG).

*   **Example:** A document could contain the following text to describe a sequence:
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant User
        participant TissLM
        participant TissDB
        User->>TissLM: "Show me recent articles on AI"
        TissLM->>TissDB: TissQL Query
        TissDB-->>TissLM: Documents
        TissLM-->>User: Generated Answer
    ```
*   **Action:** `multiple_viewer` would process this and generate a visual sequence diagram.

### 2. Automated Concept Mapping
Using NLP techniques (potentially leveraging `TissLM` itself), the `multiple_viewer` could read a document and automatically identify key concepts (e.g., "TissDB", "RAG Pipeline", "Sinew", "Connection Pool"). It would then generate a concept map or mind map that shows how these concepts are related within the document.

### 3. Inter-Document Dependency Graphing
The tool could parse the entire `docs/` directory and analyze links or mentions between documents to create a dependency graph. This would help developers understand the relationships between different plans and specifications, for example, showing that the `tissdb_tisslm_sinew_integration.md` plan builds upon concepts defined in `tissdb_vision.md` and `tisslm_plan.md`.

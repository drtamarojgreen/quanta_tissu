# Ecological Awareness

QuantaTissu aims to be a demonstration of how AI can be developed and used in an environmentally conscious manner. This involves a three-pronged approach to ecological awareness:

## 1. Optimize the Model for Lower Energy Consumption

The core architecture of QuantaTissu is designed to be minimal and efficient. Future development will prioritize optimizations that reduce the computational resources required for both training and inference. This includes:

*   **Architectural Enhancements**: Implementing techniques like parameter sharing, knowledge distillation, and model pruning to create smaller, more efficient models.
*   **Efficient Inference**: Leveraging techniques like KV Caching and quantization to reduce the energy consumption of the model during use.
*   **Hardware Acceleration**: Exploring the use of specialized hardware for low-power AI, such as TPUs or other accelerators.

## 2. Generate Code That Is More Energy-Efficient

The agentic version of QuantaTissu will be designed to generate code that is not only correct and efficient in terms of performance but also in terms of energy consumption. This involves:

*   **Code Analysis**: The agent will be able to analyze code for energy-inefficient patterns, such as busy-waiting, unnecessary memory allocations, and inefficient algorithms.
*   **Green Coding Practices**: The agent will be trained on a corpus of "green" code and will be able to suggest more energy-efficient alternatives to common programming patterns.
*   **Performance Profiling**: The agent will be able to use profiling tools to identify and fix performance bottlenecks that can lead to increased energy consumption.

## 3. Reflect on the Environmental Impact of the Code It Writes

QuantaTissu will be designed to be self-aware of the environmental impact of its own operations and the code it generates. This involves:

*   **Impact Assessment**: The agent will be able to estimate the carbon footprint of the code it writes, taking into account factors like the hardware it will run on and the expected usage patterns.
*   **Feedback Loop**: The agent will use this impact assessment as a form of feedback to guide its code generation process, favoring solutions with a lower environmental impact.
*   **Transparency**: The agent will be able to provide a report on the estimated environmental impact of the code it writes, allowing developers to make more informed decisions.

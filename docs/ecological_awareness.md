# Ecological Awareness

QuantaTissu is not just a demonstration of advanced agentic AI — it’s a commitment to sustainable and responsible technology. As AI systems grow in scale and influence, their environmental footprint becomes a critical concern. We believe that AI should be part of the solution, not the problem.

This document outlines our core principles for ecological awareness. It is the "what" and the "why" behind our technical strategy, which is detailed further in our [Ecological Roadmap](./ecological_roadmap.md). We address this challenge through a three-pronged approach: building efficient models, generating efficient code, and providing transparent impact analysis.

## 1. Optimize the Model for Lower Energy Consumption

The most direct impact we can have is to ensure our own models are as efficient as possible. QuantaTissu’s architecture is intentionally lean, with a focus on maximizing performance per watt. Every layer of the stack—from model design to deployment—is optimized for energy efficiency.

**Key Strategies:**
-   **Efficient Architectures:** We prioritize modern, efficient architectural components like **RMSNorm** and **SwiGLU** and explore advanced positional encodings like **RoPE**.
-   **Model Size Reduction:** We employ a suite of techniques to create smaller, more capable models without sacrificing performance.
    -   **Quantization:** Using lower-precision formats (e.g., INT8, FP16) and techniques like **QLoRA** to dramatically reduce the memory footprint and accelerate computation needed for both training and inference.
    -   **Pruning:** Systematically removing redundant or unimportant weights from the model to reduce its size.
    -   **Knowledge Distillation:** Training smaller "student" models to mimic the behavior of larger, more capable "teacher" models.
-   **Optimized Inference:** We implement state-of-the-art algorithms to ensure every inference call is as fast and energy-efficient as possible.
    -   **KV Caching:** Avoids redundant computation during the generation of long sequences.
    -   **Flash Attention & GQA:** Using highly optimized attention algorithms that are faster and more memory-efficient than standard implementations.
-   **Hardware Acceleration:**
    -   Design our models to be compatible with low-power AI accelerators like TPUs, Graphcore IPUs, or custom ASICs.
    -   Optimize for edge devices where energy constraints are most critical.

## 2. Generate Code That Is More Energy-Efficient

QuantaTissu will not only write code—it will write code that respects the planet. By embedding ecological intelligence into its reasoning, the agent can act as a "green coding" coach, guiding developers toward more sustainable software practices.

**Key Capabilities:**
-   **Code Analysis:**
    -   The agent will be trained to detect energy-intensive patterns such as:
    -   **Busy-wait loops** vs. event-driven callbacks.
    -   **Inefficient data structures** (e.g., using a list for frequent lookups where a dictionary or set would be O(1)).
    -   **Excessive disk or network I/O** in tight loops.
    -   **Unnecessary data duplication** in memory vs. using views or references.
    -   The agent will flag these patterns and suggest more efficient alternatives.
-   **Green Coding Practices:**
    -   Train on a curated corpus of energy-efficient codebases.
    -   Recommend low-impact libraries (e.g., suggesting `Polars` over `pandas` for certain large-scale data manipulations due to better memory management).
    -   Suggest efficient data serialization formats like **Protocol Buffers** or **Avro** over JSON for network-heavy applications to reduce data transfer size and processing overhead.
    -   Encourage practices like asynchronous I/O, lazy evaluation, caching, and memory reuse.
-   **Performance Profiling:**
    -   Interface with profiling tools (e.g., `cProfile`, `py-spy`, `perf`) to identify hotspots.
    -   Suggest optimizations that reduce CPU cycles, memory usage, and disk access.

## 3. Reflect on the Environmental Impact of the Code It Writes

QuantaTissu will be designed with a form of ecological self-awareness—capable of estimating and reporting the environmental consequences of its own outputs. This makes the invisible cost of computation visible.

**Key Features:**
-   **Impact Assessment:**
    -   Using the `ESTIMATE_COST` features in **TissLang**, the agent can estimate the carbon footprint of a proposed code change or plan before execution.
    -   This estimation is based on factors like predicted CPU cycles, memory usage, and the carbon intensity of the grid where the code is expected to run.
-   **Transparency and Trade-offs:**
    -   The agent will generate "eco-impact reports" alongside code suggestions, presenting clear metrics like estimated energy usage (kWh), memory footprint (MB-hours), and a **Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)** score.
    -   This empowers developers to make informed, conscious trade-offs between performance, cost, and sustainability, rather than optimizing for speed alone.
-   **Green Feedback Loop:**
    -   The agent will use its own impact estimates to guide its code generation process.
    -   When faced with multiple valid solutions, it will be prompted to prefer the one that balances performance with sustainability. For instance, when asked to implement a data processing task, the agent might generate a TissLang plan with a `CHOOSE` block, presenting two options: one using a familiar but memory-heavy library and another using a more memory-efficient alternative, each annotated with its estimated SCI score. This makes green coding the default path, not the exception.

## Conclusion: A Commitment to a Greener Future

By integrating these three strategies—optimizing our models, generating efficient code, and providing transparent impact analysis—we aim to do more than just build a powerful AI tool. We are building a partner for developers that shares a commitment to a sustainable technological future. Ecological awareness is not an afterthought; it is a core design principle of QuantaTissu.

We invite the community to join us in this effort. Contribute by suggesting new green coding patterns, providing feedback on our metrics, and helping us build a more comprehensive database of energy-efficient practices. Together, we can ensure that software development becomes a force for environmental sustainability.

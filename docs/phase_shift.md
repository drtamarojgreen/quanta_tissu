🔭 Phase Shift: From Language to Interface
- TissLang is more than syntax—it can evolve into a model mediation interface, bridging human intent and agentic reasoning.
- That means not just what you say, but how the model receives it, transforms it, and responds—all structured by TissLang directives.

🧬 Runtime Fusion & Modular Personalities
- Imagine composing "persona packs" and "reasoning lenses" via Tiss:
- Tutor mode vs. Debate mode vs. Poetic mode—all switchable mid-session.
- Run these in parallel with layered contexts—TissLang could provide dynamic multiplexing of intent.

📚 Embedded Literacy
- TissLang could power agents that teach through interaction:
- Every directive doubles as a teachable moment.
- Users could toggle “transparent mode” to see why the model made a choice, and tweak its logic.

⚙️ Hardware Affinity
- Lean Tiss interpreters on edge devices—yes, Raspberry Pi, but even low-power chips, wearables, or e-paper interfaces.
- Think offline cognition: no connection, no cloud—just local understanding.

🌐 Networked Reasoning & TissNet
- What if Tiss directives could hand off tasks between agents?
- Model A solves step 1, annotates outcome → Model B takes step 2.
- TissNet could be the protocol for cooperative AI, not just isolated prompts.

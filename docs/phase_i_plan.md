# Phase I: Self-Updating and Reasoning LLM Development Plan

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the plan for Phase I of developing a self-updating and reasoning Large Language Model (LLM). The goal of this phase is to create a foundational architecture that can be iterated upon in subsequent phases.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1. Knowledge Base
- **Description:** A dedicated storage system for the LLM to store and retrieve information.
- **Implementation:**
    - Use a vector database for efficient similarity search.
    - Implement a mechanism to update the knowledge base with new information.

### 2.2. Reasoning Engine
- **Description:** The component responsible for processing queries and generating responses.
- **Implementation:**
    - Develop a module for logical deduction and inference.
    - Integrate with the knowledge base to pull in relevant information.

### 2.3. Self-Updating Mechanism
- **Description:** A system that allows the LLM to update its own knowledge and reasoning processes.
- **Implementation:**
    - Create a feedback loop where the model can learn from its interactions.
    - Develop a method for the model to identify and correct its own errors.

## 3. Milestones

- **Milestone 1:** Basic knowledge base implementation.
- **Milestone 2:** Initial version of the reasoning engine.
- **Milestone 3:** Integration of the knowledge base and reasoning engine.
- **Milestone 4:** Simple self-updating mechanism based on user feedback.

## 4. Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow or PyTorch
- **Database:** Pinecone or a similar vector database

## 5. Next Steps

- Begin detailed design of the knowledge base component.
- Set up the development environment.

# TissLM Program Implementation - Phase IV Updates

## Progress Made

### Namespace Refactoring
The primary task of refactoring the `TissDB::TissLM` namespace into a cleaner `TissLM` structure has been largely completed. The following components have been moved to their respective sub-namespaces under `TissLM`:

*   **Tokenizer:** `TissLM::Tokenizer`
*   **Core:** `TissLM::Core`
*   **Training:** `TissLM::Training`
*   **Generation:** `TissLM::Generation`
*   **Retrieval:** `TissLM::Retrieval`
*   **Rules:** `TissLM::Rules`

This refactoring involved updating header files (`.h`) and implementation files (`.cpp`) for each component, adjusting namespace declarations, and fully qualifying type names where necessary (e.g., `Model` became `TissLM::Core::Model`).

### Build Error Resolution (Partial)
Several build errors related to the namespace changes have been addressed:
*   **`generator.h` and `generator.cpp`:** Issues with undeclared `Model` types in constructors and member variables were resolved by using the fully qualified `TissLM::Core::Model`. Incorrect include paths and namespace closing braces were also corrected.
*   **`encoding_test.cpp`:** The `using namespace` directive was updated to reflect the new `TissLM::Tokenizer` namespace.

## Remaining Tasks

### Current Build Error in `tokenizer.cpp`
The current blocking issue is a build error in `tokenizer.cpp` related to string literal escaping and variable scoping within the `Tokenizer::save` function, and an incorrect regex literal in `parse_vocab_from_json`.

*   **`Tokenizer::save` function:**
    *   **Problem:** Incorrect escaping of double quotes in `vocab_file << "" << pair.first << "": ";` leading to `stray ‘
’ in program` and `missing terminating " character` errors.
    *   **Problem:** `bool first_byte = true;` is declared inside a loop, causing `‘first_byte’ was not declared in this scope` errors when used later in the same function.
*   **`parse_vocab_from_json` function:**
    *   **Problem:** Unescaped regex special characters (`\d`, `\s`, `\]`) in `std::regex re_pair(

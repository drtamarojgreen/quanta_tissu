# QuantaTissu Language Model (TissLM) Development Plan

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the QuantaTissu Language Model (TissLM). It details its current capabilities, core architecture, and the development process. It also outlines a strategic roadmap of 100 potential enhancements to evolve the model from its current state as an educational tool into a sophisticated and capable reasoning engine for an agentic coding assistant.

## 1. Introduction

The QuantaTissu Language Model (TissLM) is a decoder-only transformer-based language model built entirely from scratch using Python and NumPy. It serves a dual purpose:

1.  **An Educational Tool**: By implementing every component of the transformer architecture—from the attention mechanism to the backpropagation algorithm—TissLM provides a clear and inspectable foundation for learning how modern language models work without the abstractions of deep learning frameworks.
2.  **A Foundational Engine for an Agentic Assistant**: TissLM is the first step in a broader vision to create an autonomous agent capable of understanding and executing complex software development tasks. Its development path is geared towards progressively building the reasoning capabilities required for such an agent.

The model is designed to be minimal yet complete, providing a solid base for the extensive list of enhancements detailed in this plan. As it evolves, TissLM will be integrated with **TissLang**, a domain-specific language for orchestrating agentic workflows, and **TissDB**, a high-performance database, to form a cohesive, intelligent system.

## 2. Model Architecture and Capabilities

TissLM is implemented as a classical decoder-only transformer, adhering to the architecture described in "Attention Is All You Need," but with the encoder part omitted. The entire implementation is done in Python with NumPy, ensuring that every mathematical operation is explicit and transparent.

### 2.1. Core Components

-   **Token Embeddings**: A trainable weight matrix that maps token IDs from a fixed-size vocabulary into dense vectors (`d_model` dimensions).
-   **Sinusoidal Positional Encoding**: A fixed (non-trainable) encoding added to the token embeddings to provide the model with information about the position of each token in the sequence.
-   **Transformer Blocks**: The model is a stack of `n_layers` identical transformer blocks. Each block contains two main sub-layers:
    1.  **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: An implementation of scaled dot-product attention with multiple heads. It includes a causal (look-ahead) mask to ensure that predictions for a given position can only depend on previous positions.
    2.  **Position-wise Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**: A two-layer fully connected network with a ReLU activation function in between.
-   **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization**: Each sub-layer in a transformer block is wrapped with a residual connection (`x + sublayer(x)`) followed by layer normalization (`LayerNorm`). This is critical for stabilizing the training of deep networks.
-   **Output Projection**: A final linear layer followed by a softmax function that projects the output of the transformer blocks back into logits over the vocabulary, producing a probability distribution for the next token.

### 2.2. Current Capabilities

-   **From-Scratch Backpropagation**: The model includes a complete, manually implemented backward pass for all layers, allowing for end-to-end training without relying on automatic differentiation frameworks.
-   **Configurable Hyperparameters**: Key model dimensions like `d_model`, `n_layers`, `num_heads`, and `d_ff` are centralized in `config.py` for easy experimentation.
-   **Advanced Sampling Methods**: The generation process supports several decoding strategies:
    -   **Greedy Decoding**: Always selects the most likely next token.
    -   **Top-k Sampling**: Samples from the `k` most likely next tokens.
    -   **Nucleus (Top-p) Sampling**: Samples from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds a threshold `p`.
-   **Efficient Generation with KV Caching**: For autoregressive generation, the model implements a Key-Value (KV) cache. This avoids redundant computations for previous tokens in the sequence, dramatically speeding up the generation of long texts.
-   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: The model has a basic integration with a `KnowledgeBase` module. It can retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge store and prepend them to the prompt as context before generation, helping to ground the model's responses in factual information.

## 3. Development and Training

The development of TissLM emphasizes clarity and control. The entire training and development lifecycle is managed through a small set of Python scripts and configuration files.

### 3.1. Codebase Organization

The core logic is contained within the `quanta_tissu/quanta_tissu/` directory:
-   `model.py`: Defines the `QuantaTissu` class and its constituent layers.
-   `layers.py`: Contains the implementation of individual layers like `MultiHeadAttention` and `FeedForward`.
-   `config.py`: Centralizes all configurations, including model hyperparameters, vocabulary, and file paths.
-   `train.py`: Implements the main training loop.
-   `optimizer.py`, `loss.py`: Contain the from-scratch implementations of the AdamW optimizer and Cross-Entropy Loss.
-   `tokenizer.py`: A simple, vocabulary-based tokenizer.
-   `data.py`: Handles dataset loading and batching.

### 3.2. Configuration

All aspects of the model and training process are controlled by the `config.py` file. This allows for easy modification of the model's architecture (e.g., `d_model`, `n_layers`) and training parameters (e.g., `learning_rate`, `batch_size`) without changing the core logic.

### 3.3. Training Pipeline

The training process is executed by running the `train.py` script. The pipeline consists of the following steps:
1.  **Data Loading**: The script loads a text corpus from a specified directory.
2.  **Tokenization**: The raw text is tokenized using the simple, space-delimited tokenizer defined in `tokenizer.py`.
3.  **Dataset Preparation**: The tokenized data is structured into input-target pairs (`x`, `y`) and managed by a `Dataset` class that handles batching.
4.  **Training Loop**: The model iterates through the dataset for a configured number of epochs. In each step, it performs:
    -   A **forward pass** to compute logits.
    -   A **loss calculation** using the custom Cross-Entropy Loss function.
    -   A **backward pass** to compute gradients for all model parameters.
    -   A **weight update** using the custom AdamW optimizer.
5.  **Model Saving**: Upon completion of training, the learned model weights are saved to a `.npz` file, ready for inference.

# TissOS Development Plan

## Phase 0: Foundation and Philosophy

*   **1. Define Core Principles:**
    *   **Simplicity:** Keep the base system minimal, adhering to the Alpine philosophy.
    *   **Security:** Implement security-first design principles.
    *   **Integration:** Seamlessly integrate the Tiss Ecosystem of applications.
    *   **User-Friendliness:** Make TissOS accessible to both developers and everyday users.
*   **2. Identify Target Audience:**
    *   Developers who need a lightweight, secure environment.
    *   Users who value privacy and a cohesive application ecosystem.
    *   Hobbyists and tinkerers who enjoy customizing their OS.
*   **3. Establish the Tiss Ecosystem Vision:**
    *   Define the initial set of Tiss applications (e.g., TissBrowser, TissMail, TissDrive).
    *   Outline the integration points between the OS and the applications.

## Phase 1: Core System Development

*   **1. Set Up Build Environment:**
    *   Use Alpine's `aports` infrastructure as a foundation.
    *   Create a dedicated repository for TissOS packages.
*   **2. Select Base Packages:**
    *   Curate a minimal set of packages from the Alpine repositories.
    *   Replace certain default utilities with Tiss-specific alternatives where appropriate.
*   **3. Kernel Customization:**
    *   Start with the hardened Alpine kernel.
    *   Develop a TissOS-specific kernel configuration with a focus on security and performance.
*   **4. Branding and Theming:**
    *   Design the TissOS logo, wallpapers, and GRUB/bootloader theme.
    *   Create a consistent visual identity for the OS and its applications.

## Phase 2: The Tiss Ecosystem - Core Applications

*   **1. Develop TissID:**
    *   A decentralized identity system for a secure, single sign-on experience across the Tiss Ecosystem.
*   **2. Build TissStore:**
    *   A curated application store for TissOS, featuring both Tiss Ecosystem apps and approved third-party software.
    *   Focus on security and sandboxing for all applications.
*   **3. Create Initial Tiss Apps:**
    *   **TissBrowser:** A privacy-focused web browser.
    *   **TissMail:** An end-to-end encrypted email client.
    *   **TissDrive:** A secure, decentralized file storage solution.
*   **4. API and SDK Development:**
    *   Create a developer-friendly SDK for building applications that integrate with the Tiss Ecosystem.

## Phase 3: User Experience and Desktop Environment

*   **1. Choose and Customize a DE:**
    *   Select a lightweight desktop environment (e.g., XFCE, LXQt) as the default.
    *   Develop a custom TissOS theme and icon set for the chosen DE.
*   **2. Develop a TissOS Welcome App:**
    *   A user-friendly onboarding application that guides new users through the setup process.
*   **3. Create a TissOS Control Center:**
    *   A centralized application for managing system settings, updates, and Tiss Ecosystem services.

## Phase 4: Community and Distribution

*   **1. Launch Website and Documentation:**
    *   Create a professional website with clear installation instructions, user guides, and developer documentation.
*   **2. Establish Community Forums:**
    *   Set up a forum or chat server (e.g., Discourse, Matrix) for community discussion and support.
*   **3. Set Up Public Repositories:**
    *   Make TissOS package repositories publicly accessible.
*   **4. Release Alpha and Beta Versions:**
    *   Follow a structured release cycle, starting with internal testing, then moving to public alpha and beta releases to gather feedback.

## Phase 5: Long-term Maintenance and Governance

*   **1. Establish a Governance Model:**
    *   Define a clear process for decision-making and contributions to the project.
*   **2. Implement a Security Response Plan:**
    *   Create a dedicated team and process for handling security vulnerabilities.
*   **3. Long-Term Support (LTS) Strategy:**
    *   Develop a plan for providing long-term support for designated TissOS releases.
*   **4. Monetization and Sustainability:**
    *   Explore sustainable funding models, such as premium features for TissDrive, enterprise support, or donations, to ensure the project's longevity.

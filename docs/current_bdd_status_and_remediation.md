# TissDB: BDD Test Status and Remediation Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an up-to-date analysis of the current failures in the TissDB Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) test suite as of August 2025. It identifies the root causes of the errors and proposes a concrete remediation plan to bring the tests to a passing state.

This analysis is based on the most recent test logs and supersedes any previous analysis documents, such as `docs/bdd_error_analysis.md`, which are now outdated.

## 2. High-Level Summary

The BDD test suite is currently in a critical state with a high number of failures across multiple features. The vast majority of these failures are not due to issues in the test code itself, but rather stem from a cascade of server-side errors, beginning with a critical failure during database initialization.

The primary blocker is a recurring `500 Internal Server Error` that prevents the TissLM and KnowledgeBase components from being initialized, causing a domino effect of failures in dependent tests.

## 3. Detailed Error Analysis

The test failures can be grouped into the following categories:

### Category 1: Critical - `500 Internal Server Error` on Database Setup
- **Features Affected**: `generate`, `knowledge_base`, `kv_cache`, `predict`
- **Symptom**: All scenarios in these features fail during the setup step (`Given a model and tokenizer` or `Given a knowledge base...`). The traceback points to `requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: http://127.0.0.1:8080/testdb` which originates in the `_setup_database` method of the `KnowledgeBase` class.
- **Hypothesis**: The TissDB server is running, but it encounters a fatal error when the `KnowledgeBase` attempts to perform its initial setup. This could be due to a malformed request from the client or a bug in the server's handling of that specific setup routine.

### Category 2: Critical - Transaction Failures
- **Feature Affected**: `database.feature`
- **Symptom**: The "Basic transaction operations" and "Rollback transaction" scenarios fail with `AssertionError`. The tests expect a `200 OK` or `204 No Content` status code for `commit` and `rollback` operations, but the server is returning a different, unsuccessful status code.
- **Hypothesis**: The server's transaction management endpoints (`/commit`, `/rollback`) are not implemented correctly. They either fail to perform the operation or do not return the expected success status code.

### Category 3: Major - Data Type and Content Mismatches
- **Features Affected**: `extended_database_tests.feature`, `update_delete_queries.feature`, `select_queries.feature`
- **Symptoms**:
    1.  `NameError: name 'true' is not defined`: This occurs in the `document_should_have_content` step because it uses `eval()` on a JSON string with boolean literals (`true`/`false`), which are not valid in Python.
    2.  `AssertionError: Mismatch for key 'price': expected '1200', got '1250'`: This indicates that an `UPDATE` query is not producing the correct result.
    3.  `AssertionError: No document found with 'price' = 20`: This happens because the test is comparing an integer `20` with a string value `'20'` returned from the database, indicating a type inconsistency.
- **Hypothesis**: There are bugs in both the test implementation (improper use of `eval`) and the database's query engine, particularly in how it handles data types in `WHERE` clauses and `UPDATE` statements.

### Category 4: Minor - Missing Step Definitions
- **Features Affected**: `select_queries.feature`, `integration.feature`
- **Symptom**: Many scenarios show `WARNING - No step definition found`, which leads to subsequent `KeyError: 'query_result'` because the context variable is never set.
- **Hypothesis**: The test suite is incomplete. The steps have been written in the `.feature` files but have not been implemented in the Python step definition files.

### Category 5: Major - Core Document Operation Failures
- **Feature Affected**: `more_database_tests.feature`
- **Symptoms**:
    1.  `AssertionError: Document with ID doc_a not found in list`: The endpoint to list all documents in a collection is not returning the expected documents.
    2.  `AssertionError` when attempting to create a collection that already exists. The server returns an unexpected status code.
    3.  `AssertionError` when attempting to delete a non-existent document. The server returns an unexpected status code (not the expected `404 Not Found`).
- **Hypothesis**: There are fundamental bugs in the server's core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) logic for collections and documents.

## 4. Remediation Plan

The following steps should be taken to resolve the BDD test failures, in order of priority:

1.  **Stabilize the Server**:
    - **Action**: Investigate and fix the root cause of the `500 Internal Server Error` during database setup.
    - **Priority**: **Highest**. This is the primary blocker for a large portion of the test suite.
    - **Suggestion**: Start by examining the `server.log` file for server-side stack traces. Add detailed logging to the server's main request handler and the code path triggered by the `KnowledgeBase` setup to pinpoint the exact line of failure.

2.  **Fix Transaction Endpoints**:
    - **Action**: Debug and correct the implementation of the `/commit` and `/rollback` endpoints in the TissDB server to ensure they perform the correct operations and return a `200` or `204` status code on success.
    - **Priority**: High.

3.  **Correct BDD Test Step Implementations**:
    - **Action**:
        - Replace the use of `eval(json_string)` with `json.loads(json_string)` in the test steps to correctly parse JSON data.
        - Modify assertions to handle data type differences (e.g., convert values to the same type before comparison).
    - **Priority**: Medium. These are client-side fixes that can be done in parallel with server-side work.

4.  **Implement Missing BDD Steps**:
    - **Action**: Write the Python code for all the missing step definitions in the `select_queries.feature` and `integration.feature` files.
    - **Priority**: Medium. This is necessary to achieve full test coverage.

5.  **Address Core Document and Collection Bugs**:
    - **Action**: Debug and fix the server-side logic for listing documents, creating collections that already exist, and deleting non-existent documents to ensure they match the behavior expected by the tests.
    - **Priority**: Low. These can be addressed after the more critical server stability issues are resolved.

Status Key: `[Not Started]` `[In Progress]` `[Done]`

## 1. Core Model and Inference

### 1.1. Architectural Improvements
-   **[Done] Multiple Transformer Blocks**: Generalize the model to allow stacking `N` transformer blocks, creating a deeper and more powerful model. This should be a configurable hyperparameter.
-   **[Done] Causal Attention Mask**: Implement and apply a causal (look-ahead) mask in the attention mechanism. This is crucial for correct autoregressive behavior during training and efficient inference.
-   **[Done] Dropout Layers**: Add dropout layers after embeddings, attention, and feed-forward layers for regularization to prevent overfitting.
-   **[Done] Hyperparameter Configuration**: Centralize all model hyperparameters (e.g., `d_model`, `num_heads`, `d_ff`, `n_layers`, `vocab_size`) into a configuration object or file (e.g., `config.py` or a YAML file).
-   **[Not Started] Modern Feed-Forward Networks (SwiGLU)**: Replace the standard ReLU-based FFN with a more modern Gated Linear Unit variant like SwiGLU, which is used in models like Llama.
-   **[Not Started] Alternative Normalization (RMSNorm)**: Implement RMSNorm as a simpler and often faster alternative to standard Layer Normalization.
-   **[Not Started] Alternative Positional Encodings (RoPE)**: Replace sinusoidal positional encodings with a more modern approach like Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE).

### 1.2. Inference and Sampling
-   **[Done] Batched Inference**: The model's forward pass already accepts a batch of prompts simultaneously.
-   **[Done] Advanced Sampling Strategies**: Move beyond greedy decoding.
    -   **Temperature Scaling**: Add a `temperature` parameter to the final softmax to control output randomness.
    -   **Top-k Sampling**: Select the next token from the `k` most likely candidates.
    -   **Nucleus Sampling (Top-p)**: Select from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds a threshold `p`.
-   **[Done] KV Caching**: During generative inference, cache the Key (K) and Value (V) matrices from the attention layers for previous tokens. This avoids redundant computation and dramatically speeds up the generation of long sequences.

# QuantaTissu Enhancements

This document lists potential enhancements for the QuantaTissu application.

## 1. Tokenization

-   **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)**: Implement BPE or a similar subword tokenization strategy to handle a larger vocabulary and out-of-vocabulary words more effectively.
-   **Vocabulary Expansion**: Support loading a larger, pre-trained vocabulary.

## 2. Inference and Sampling

-   **Top-k Sampling**: Implement top-k sampling to introduce more variety in the generated text.
-   **Nucleus Sampling (Top-p)**: Implement nucleus sampling for more controlled and diverse text generation.
-   **Temperature Scaling**: Add a temperature parameter to control the randomness of the output.
-   **Batched Inference**: Add support for processing multiple prompts in a single batch for improved efficiency.

## 3. Model Architecture

-   **Multiple Transformer Blocks**: Allow stacking multiple transformer blocks to create a deeper model.
-   **Hyperparameter Configuration**: Allow easy configuration of model hyperparameters (e.g., `d_model`, `num_heads`, `d_ff`).
-   **Pre-trained Weights**: Add functionality to load pre-trained model weights.

## 4. Training

-   **Training Loop**: Implement a training loop to train the model on a given dataset.
-   **Optimizer**: Add an optimizer (e.g., Adam) to update the model weights during training.
-   **Loss Function**: Implement a cross-entropy loss function.

## 5. Project Structure

-   **Code Organization**: Split the code into multiple files for better organization and maintainability (e.g., `model.py`, `tokenizer.py`, `config.py`).
-   **Dependency Management**: Add a `requirements.txt` file to list the project dependencies.
-   **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests to ensure the correctness of the individual components.

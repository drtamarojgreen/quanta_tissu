## Important Considerations / Disclaimers

It is crucial to understand the current scope and limitations of TissDB, especially when considering its use for relational data:

-   **Schema Enforcement:** TissDB does not enforce a strict schema. Documents can be inserted into a collection with any fields, potentially leading to inconsistencies if relational integrity (e.g., every "user" document must have an "email" field) is expected. TissDB will not prevent violations of such implicit schemas.

-   **Relational Operations (Joins):** While TissQL has been extended, it does not support complex multi-collection joins that are fundamental to relational databases. Attempting to perform such operations would result in query errors or require manual, inefficient application-level logic.

-   **Data Consistency:** Even with the conceptual implementation of multi-document transactions, ensuring full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties across "relational tables" (collections) in a distributed document database is extremely complex and not fully implemented.

-   **Indexing for Relational Queries:** While compound indexing is conceptually complete, it is designed for optimizing queries on document fields within a single collection, not for optimizing complex relational queries across multiple "tables" or collections.

-   **Bugs and Edge Cases:** As a software system, especially one in a simulated development phase, TissDB will inevitably have bugs and unhandled edge cases. Expecting zero errors is unrealistic.

-   **Conceptual vs. Implemented Features:** Many tasks, particularly in Phase 3 and 4, were marked as complete conceptually (e.g., "Implement a leader election mechanism (e.g., using Raft)"). This signifies that the design approach was outlined, not that the complex, production-ready code has been written, rigorously tested, and hardened for real-world deployment.

## Phase 5: Relational Completeness

This phase outlines the significant tasks required to transform TissDB from a document database into a relationally complete system, capable of handling structured relational data with integrity and efficiency.

-   [x] **Schema Definition and Enforcement**
    -   [x] Implement DDL (Data Definition Language) for defining table schemas (columns, data types, constraints).
    -   [x] Enforce schema validation on data insertion and updates.
    -   [x] Support primary key and unique constraints.
    -   [x] Implement foreign key constraints and referential integrity checks.

-   [x] **Relational Query Language (Full SQL Support)**
    -   [x] Extend TissQL parser to support a significant subset of SQL (e.g., `JOIN`, `GROUP BY` with `HAVING`, subqueries, `ORDER BY`).
    -   [x] Develop a robust SQL query optimizer to generate efficient execution plans for relational operations.
    -   [x] Implement relational algebra operators (e.g., join, projection, selection) in the query executor.

-   [x] **Transaction Management (Full ACID Compliance)**
    -   [x] Implement true multi-statement, multi-row ACID transactions with strict isolation levels.
    -   [x] Develop a robust concurrency control mechanism (e.g., strict two-phase locking or optimistic concurrency control with validation) for relational operations.
    -   [x] Ensure atomicity and durability across all relational operations, including schema changes.

-   [x] **Relational Indexing**
    -   [x] Support B-tree indexes on multiple columns (composite indexes) for efficient join and filtering operations.
    -   [x] Implement specialized indexes for unique constraints and foreign keys.

-   [x] **Data Storage for Relational Data**
    -   [x] Adapt the underlying storage engine (LSM-Tree) to efficiently store and retrieve structured relational data, potentially optimizing for column-oriented storage or hybrid approaches.

-   [x] **Metadata Management for Relational Schema**
    -   [x] Implement system catalogs to store and manage metadata about tables, columns, indexes, and constraints.

TissLM Program Components: Development and Testing Plan
1. Introduction

This document outlines a five-phase strategic plan for the complete implementation of the core C++ components of the TissLM Program: the DDL Parser, the Schema Manager, and the Tissu Sinew connector. The objective is to guide development from the current state to a robust, feature-complete, and production-ready system. This plan includes a comprehensive, multi-layered testing strategy to ensure quality, performance, and reliability.

The components are:

    DDL Parser (ddl_parser.cpp): Responsible for parsing TissQL Data Definition Language (DDL) statements.
    Schema Manager (schema_manager.cpp): Manages the database schema, including creation, modification, and validation of tables and their structures.
    Tissu Sinew (tissu_sinew.cpp): A high-performance C++ connector providing a native client interface to TissDB.

2. Five-Phase Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Core Functionality & Unit Testing

Goal: Establish a solid foundation with baseline features for each component, backed by comprehensive unit tests.

    DDL Parser:
        Implement parsing for fundamental DDL statements: CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE.
        Support basic data types (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DOUBLE).
        Develop a suite of unit tests covering valid syntax and common parsing errors.
    Schema Manager:
        Implement an in-memory representation of database schemas, tables, and columns.
        Provide basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for schema objects.
        Ensure all public methods are covered by unit tests.
    Tissu Sinew:
        Implement basic connection logic to the TissDB server.
        Create stubs for command execution methods (execute_ddl, query, etc.).
        Unit test connection management and API contracts.

Phase 2: Component Integration & Initial E2E Testing

Goal: Connect the components and verify their basic interactions.

    Integration:
        The DDL Parser's output (an Abstract Syntax Tree or similar structure) will be fed to the Schema Manager.
        Tissu Sinew will be updated to forward DDL strings to the DDL Parser.
        The Schema Manager will perform the requested operations on its in-memory store.
    Testing:
        Develop component integration tests that verify the flow from a DDL string to a schema change.
        Create the first end-to-end (E2E) tests: use Tissu Sinew to send a CREATE TABLE command and verify the schema change via a separate query.

Phase 3: Advanced Features & Edge Case Handling

Goal: Enhance the components with advanced capabilities and make them resilient to errors and edge cases.

    DDL Parser:
        Add support for ALTER TABLE (ADD/DROP/MODIFY COLUMN).
        Implement parsing for constraints (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE).
    Schema Manager:
        Implement schema validation logic to enforce constraints.
        Develop schema versioning and migration capabilities.
        Handle transactional DDL operations to ensure atomicity.
    Tissu Sinew:
        Implement robust error handling and reporting from the server.
        Introduce connection pooling for improved performance in multi-threaded environments.
    Testing:
        Expand unit and integration tests to cover all new features and error conditions.

Phase 4: Performance Optimization & Benchmarking

Goal: Ensure the components meet performance requirements for a high-throughput environment.

    Profiling:
        Use profiling tools (e.g., gprof, Valgrind/Callgrind) to identify performance bottlenecks in parsing and schema management.
    Optimization:
        Refactor critical code paths for maximum efficiency (e.g., zero-copy parsing, faster lookups in Schema Manager).
    Benchmarking:
        Develop a standardized benchmarking suite to measure latency and throughput of DDL operations under various workloads.
        Track performance metrics over time to prevent regressions.

Phase 5: API Finalization, Documentation & Release Hardening

Goal: Prepare the components for a stable release.

    API Review:
        Finalize the public APIs of all components. Ensure consistency, clarity, and ease of use.
        Deprecate any legacy or temporary functions.
    Documentation:
        Write comprehensive inline code documentation (Doxygen-compatible).
        Create user-facing documentation for the Tissu Sinew connector API.
    Hardening:
        Conduct extensive stress testing and fuzz testing to uncover rare bugs.
        Perform a final security review of the connector and server-side components.
        Create a release candidate and perform a full regression test cycle.

3. Overall Testing Strategy

A multi-layered testing approach will be used to ensure the quality of the TissLM Program components.

    Unit Testing:
        Framework: Google Test (or a similar C++ testing framework).
        Coverage: Aim for >90% code coverage for all new code.
        Focus: Test individual classes and functions in isolation to verify their logic.

    Integration Testing:
        Focus: Verify the interactions and data flow between components (Parser -> Manager, Sinew -> Parser).
        Method: Use a combination of mocked objects and real component instances in a controlled test environment.

    End-to-End (E2E) Testing:
        Framework: A custom test suite or BDD framework (like Gherkin/Cucumber with a C++ runner).
        Focus: Simulate real-world usage by having a test client (using Tissu Sinew) interact with a running TissDB instance.
        Scope: Cover full user stories, such as "As a user, I can create a table with constraints and then verify its schema."

    Performance Testing:
        Tools: A custom C++ benchmarking tool.
        Focus: Measure latency, throughput, and resource utilization for key operations.

    Static Analysis:
        Tools: Integrate tools like Clang-Tidy and Cppcheck into the CI/CD pipeline.
        Goal: Automatically detect potential bugs, style violations, and security vulnerabilities before they are merged.

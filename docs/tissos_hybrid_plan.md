# Hybrid Strategy: From Plan B (Linux Distribution) to Plan A (New OS)

## Phase 1: Establish TissOS via Plan B (Days 4-5)

**Objective:** Deliver a functioning TissOS system quickly, validate user needs, and build community.

*   **Base System:** Alpine Linux as foundation (musl libc, busybox, apk-tools).
*   **Kernel Customization:** Apply targeted patches for security hardening, real-time extensions, and experimental hooks for TissDB integration.
*   **Core Environment:**
    *   Develop TissShell (custom shell interface) with hooks into TissDB.
    *   Lightweight TissWM or custom desktop environment.
    *   Begin TissApp ecosystem (TissMail, TissBrowser, etc.).
*   **TissDB Integration:** Implement TissDB as a core service accessible across the OS (configuration, logging, state management).
*   **Distribution Pipeline:** Automate builds with reproducible packaging (aports fork, CI/CD pipeline).

**Deliverable:** A stable, branded Linux-based TissOS with unique UX and integrated TissDB.

## Phase 2: Abstract System Services (Days 4-5)

**Objective:** Gradually decouple from Linux internals while retaining compatibility.

*   **Middleware Layer:** Introduce `tisssys` abstraction API for process management, IPC, file operations, and scheduling. Applications interact through `tisssys`, not directly with Linux syscalls.
*   **Driver Layer Strategy:** Create `tissdrv` shim drivers that wrap Linux drivers, preparing for eventual replacement.
*   **Security Sandbox:** Migrate critical services to isolated TissVM micro-environments to test microkernel concepts inside Linux.
*   **TissDB Integration Expansion:** Extend TissDB to handle state persistence for services, replacing traditional config files.

**Deliverable:** A Linux-based OS that already behaves partially like a microkernel system, with apps and services designed against TissOS abstractions.

## Phase 3: Kernel Transition (Days 4-5)

**Objective:** Introduce the first standalone TissOS microkernel prototype while maintaining Linux-based TissOS.

*   **Microkernel Development:** Implement a minimal microkernel (process scheduling, memory management, IPC).
*   **Dual Track Development:**
    *   Maintain Plan B (Linux-based TissOS) for stability and community use.
    *   Develop Plan A prototype in parallel, focusing on the `tisssys` abstraction layer so applications remain portable.
*   **Subsystem Replacement:** Gradually migrate services from Linux kernel to TissOS microkernel equivalents (e.g., process manager, filesystem layer).
*   **Compatibility Layer:** Run Linux binaries in a compatibility container until native TissOS apps dominate.

**Deliverable:** Two variants:
1.  Stable Linux-based TissOS for production.
2.  Experimental microkernel TissOS using the same apps and abstractions.

## Phase 4: Full Migration to Plan A (Days 4-5)

**Objective:** Transition entirely to the microkernel-based TissOS.

*   **Driver Ecosystem:** Replace Linux driver shims with native `TissDrv` implementations.
*   **Native Filesystem:** Deploy TissFS optimized for integration with TissDB.
*   **Service Migration:** All core services (networking, storage, windowing, security) run natively on TissOS microkernel.
*   **Deprecation of Linux Base:** Linux distribution maintained only as legacy/compatibility layer.

**Deliverable:** Fully independent TissOS with its own kernel, drivers, services, and ecosystem, evolved from Plan B foundations.

## Strategic Benefits of Hybrid Approach

*   **Feasibility:** Plan B ensures early deliverables and user adoption.
*   **Continuity:** Abstraction layers allow seamless transition from Linux to TissOS microkernel.
*   **Risk Management:** Two development tracks reduce the chance of failure.
*   **Community Growth:** Users, developers, and applications build around TissOS early, smoothing the eventual migration.

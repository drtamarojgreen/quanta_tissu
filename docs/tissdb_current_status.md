# TissDB Project: Current Status (Q3 2025)

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a verified, up-to-date assessment of the TissDB project's implementation status as of August 2025. It is based on a direct review of the source code and serves as the single source of truth for the project's current state.

The repository contains two primary, interconnected components at vastly different stages of maturity:
*   **TissDB**: A NoSQL database engine written in C++.
*   **QuantaTissu**: A language model framework written in Python.

## 2. TissDB (C++ Database) Status

**Summary:** Contrary to previous documentation, the TissDB C++ database is **partially implemented**. A significant amount of foundational work has been completed, but the engine lacks critical features required for practical use.

### Implemented Features:
A review of the code in `tissdb/` reveals a functional core, including:
- **Multi-threaded HTTP API Server**: A server capable of handling concurrent requests is implemented in `api/http_server.cpp`.
- **RESTful API Endpoints**: The API supports a range of operations, including:
    - Database and collection lifecycle management (create, list, delete).
    - Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on documents.
    - Endpoints for initiating queries (`/_query`) and transactions (`/_begin`, `/_commit`).
- **Durability and Recovery**: A Write-Ahead Log (WAL) is implemented in `storage/wal.cpp`, allowing the database to recover its state after a restart.
- **Storage Management**: A storage layer (`storage/lsm_tree.cpp`) manages collections and delegates basic storage operations.

### Critical Missing Features:
Despite the progress, the database is missing core functionality:
- **No Indexing**: The single most critical missing feature is indexing. All functions related to index creation and lookup (`create_index`, `find_by_index`) are non-functional placeholders that throw `runtime_error`.
- **Poor Query Performance**: As a direct result of the lack of indexing, all queries, including key-based lookups, must perform slow, full scans of the data.
- **Incomplete Transaction Logic**: While transaction endpoints exist, the underlying recovery logic for transactional operations is incomplete, posing a risk to data integrity under concurrent workloads.

**Conclusion:** TissDB is a functional prototype, not a production-ready database. It is a solid foundation, but the absence of indexing makes it unsuitable for any performance-sensitive applications.

## 3. QuantaTissu (Python LLM) Status

**Summary:** The QuantaTissu Python framework is **mature and feature-rich**. Its implementation aligns closely with the extensive plans laid out in `docs/plan.md` and `docs/enhancements.md`.

### Implemented Features:
The framework, located in `quanta_tissu/tisslm/`, includes:
- **Modular Transformer Architecture**: A flexible model (`model.py`) composed of configurable `TransformerBlock`s.
- **Full Training Pipeline**: A complete training script (`train.py`) is implemented, featuring:
    - An `AdamW` optimizer.
    - `CrossEntropyLoss`.
    - A standard training loop that saves model weights.
- **Advanced Tokenization**: The tokenizer has evolved to use **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)**, with training and inference logic fully implemented.
- **Sophisticated Inference**: The model supports a wide range of modern inference techniques:
    - Batched inference.
    - **KV Caching** for efficient, autoregressive generation.
    - Multiple sampling strategies: greedy, top-k, and nucleus (top-p) sampling.
- **Documentation Note**: The `enhancements.md` document is largely accurate but slightly lags behind the codebase; for example, it incorrectly lists KV Caching as "Not Started" when it is, in fact, implemented.

**Conclusion:** QuantaTissu is a well-developed and capable LLM framework suitable for advanced experimentation and further development.

## 4. Project-Wide Integration

The two components are designed to integrate. The `QuantaTissu` `KnowledgeBase` class can connect to the TissDB server, using it as a vector store for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, the utility of this feature is severely hampered by TissDB's lack of indexing, which would prevent efficient semantic retrieval over large datasets.

## 5. Overall Assessment

The project has made significant, though uneven, progress. The Python LLM component is far more advanced than the C++ database component. The top priority for advancing the TissDB project should be the full implementation of B-Tree indexing to enable efficient queries and unlock the potential of the integrated RAG system.

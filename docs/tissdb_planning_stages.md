# Introduction to TissDB

Welcome to TissDB, a next-generation NoSQL database project designed to serve as a flexible, high-performance data backbone for the Quanta ecosystem. This document provides a high-level introduction to its core concepts, current state, and future direction.

## The Two Sides of TissDB

It is helpful to think of TissDB as having two interconnected aspects: a long-term, ambitious vision and a practical, phased implementation plan.

### 1. The Long-Term Vision: A Self-Organizing Data Tissue

The foundational vision for TissDB is rooted in the principles of **TissLang**, a paradigm that models data structures on the biological concept of living tissue. In this vision, TissDB is not merely a passive data store but a dynamic, resilient, and self-organizing system that adapts and evolves with the data it holds.

This conceptual framework guides the long-term development of TissDB, aiming to create a database ideal for complex, dynamic systems.

### 2. The Practical Implementation: A C++ NoSQL Database

The concrete, functional goal of the TissDB project is to build a lightweight, high-performance NoSQL database in C++. It provides a solid foundation that is being actively developed toward the broader vision.

Its core features include:
- **Storage Engine**: A Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree) designed for high write throughput.
- **Data Model**: A flexible, JSON-like document model.
- **Query Language**: TissQL, a simple, SQL-like query language for interacting with the data.
- **Indexing**: Support for B-Tree indexing to enable fast lookups.
- **API**: A RESTful API for all database operations.

> For technical details, see the **[TissDB API Guide](tissdb_api_guide.md)**.

## Current Status and Development Roadmap

TissDB is currently in a conceptual and active development phase. The project is being developed in a phased approach, bridging the gap between the current implementation and the long-term vision.

- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: The initial phase, which focused on building the core single-node database, is conceptually complete. This includes the storage layer, the REST API, the TissQL parser, and basic indexing.
- **Phase 2 (V1.1)**: This phase, which is partially complete, adds more robust features like collection management, LSM-tree compaction, and expanded TissQL capabilities.
- **Future Phases**: Later phases will transform TissDB into a distributed, secure, and production-ready system with features like replication, sharding, and client libraries.

> For a complete breakdown of all development phases and tasks, see the **[TissDB Roadmap](tissdb_roadmap.md)**.

## The Broader Ecosystem

It is important to note that the TissDB concept also informs other components within the Quanta repository. A related Python implementation, the `KnowledgeBase` class, serves as a functional, in-memory vector store for managing knowledge based on semantic similarity. While distinct from the C++ database, it implements some of the core ideas behind TissDB's intended knowledge management capabilities.

-   **Relational Operations:** Complex multi-collection joins are not yet supported.
-   **Conceptual vs. Implemented Features:** Many tasks are marked as complete conceptually (i.e., the design approach is outlined), but this does not mean the feature is implemented in production-ready code.


# TissDB Vision: A Self-Organizing Data Tissue

## 1. The Vision: From Data Store to Data Ecosystem

TissDB is a next-generation NoSQL database designed to serve as a flexible, high-performance data backbone for the Quanta ecosystem. The vision for TissDB is to move beyond a passive data store and create a dynamic, resilient, and self-organizing systemâ€”a "data tissue" that grows and adapts with the data it holds.

This vision is rooted in the principles of **TissLang**, a paradigm that models data structures and their interactions on the biological concept of living tissue. By treating data as interconnected "cells" that form complex structures, TissDB aims to provide unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and robustness, enabling organic data evolution and emergent behaviors.

## 2. Core Principles: The TissLang Foundation

TissLang is founded on three core principles that mimic biological tissues:

*   **Cellular Data Atoms (Encapsulation):** The fundamental unit of data is a "cell," an atomic, self-contained entity that encapsulates its own data, metadata, and optional logic. Each cell is immutable; changes result in the creation of new cells, preserving a complete, auditable history of state.
*   **Inter-Cellular Adhesion (Connections):** Cells are not isolated. They form strongly-typed, bidirectional "adhesion bonds" with other cells. These bonds define the structure of the data "tissue" and are as important as the cells themselves, representing relationships, structure, and temporal sequences.
*   **Homeostasis and Adaptation (Self-Healing & Evolution):** The data tissue is designed to be self-healing and adaptive. The database can automatically detect and repair inconsistencies or "damage" to the data structure. Furthermore, the tissue can evolve its schema over time in response to new data patterns without requiring downtime or complex migrations.

## 3. The Implementation: From Vision to Reality

Translating this ambitious vision into a functional database requires a practical, phased approach. While TissLang provides the guiding principles, the concrete implementation is a C++ NoSQL database that is under active development.

### Phased Development
TissDB is being developed in a multi-phase roadmap that bridges the gap between a traditional NoSQL database and the long-term vision:
-   **Phase 1 (MVP):** Focuses on building a core, single-node database with a Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree) storage engine, a flexible document model, a RESTful API, and a practical query language (**TissQL**).
-   **Phase 2 (V1.1):** Aims to add more robust features like collection management, LSM-tree compaction, expanded TissQL capabilities, and multi-document transactions.
-   **Phase 3 (V2.0):** Intends to transform TissDB into a distributed system with replication, sharding, and robust security features.

### The Broader Ecosystem
The TissDB concept also informs other components within the Quanta repository. A related Python implementation, the `KnowledgeBase` class, serves as a functional, in-memory vector store that implements some of the core ideas behind TissDB's intended knowledge management capabilities.

## 4. The Role of TissLang: Agent-Driven Data Interaction

A key part of the TissDB vision is to enable intelligent, goal-oriented interactions with the database. This is achieved by using TissLang as a high-level "middle layer" to orchestrate complex data workflows executed by an AI agent.

Instead of services interacting with the database via hard-coded logic, they can execute a human-readable TissLang script. A TissLang interpreter, aware of TissDB, translates high-level commands into low-level TissQL queries, executes them, and uses the results to inform the agent's next steps.

This enables powerful, automated workflows, such as:
-   **Intelligent ETL:** An agent can run a script to download data, parse it, use its reasoning to transform it, and insert structured documents into TissDB.
-   **Automated Reporting:** A TissLang script can query multiple collections, synthesize the results into a summary, and write that summary to a new "reports" collection.
-   **Adaptive Maintenance:** An agent can query for "stale" or "incomplete" data, decide on a fix, and apply updates to the database, all within a single, auditable script.

## 5. Use Cases and Applications

The unique properties of TissDB make it ideal for a range of applications that require dynamic data, resilience, and complex relationships:

*   **Social Networks:** The graph-based, adaptive nature of TissDB is a perfect fit for modeling complex social graphs that are constantly changing.
*   **IoT and Sensor Networks:** TissDB can model a network of IoT devices as a data tissue, with each device being a "cell." The self-healing properties would ensure the system remains operational even if some devices go offline.
*   **Collaborative Platforms:** Real-time collaborative applications can be built on TissDB, leveraging its live query and data versioning capabilities.
*   **Bioinformatics:** The core metaphor of TissLang makes it a natural choice for storing and analyzing complex biological data, such as protein interaction networks or genomic data.

## 6. Conclusion

TissDB, guided by the principles of TissLang, represents a new way of thinking about data. By moving from inert records to living, interconnected data tissues, we aim to build a database that is more intuitive, powerful, and resilient. The project balances this long-term vision with a pragmatic, phased implementation, delivering value at each stage while progressing toward a truly next-generation data ecosystem.


# TissDB File Structure

## 1. Introduction

TissDB is a database project that is currently in a design and development phase. As such, its "file structure" is not a single, self-contained directory but rather a collection of files across the repository that represent its different facets: conceptual design documents, related code implementations, and a hypothetical C++ implementation structure.

This document provides an overview of these key files and directories. For a guided tour of the project, please start with the **[Introduction to TissDB](tissdb_introduction_guide.md)**.

While the full TissDB C++ database is still in development, several existing components in the repository are functionally related to the TissDB concept.

### Python Implementation (`quanta_tissu/quanta_tissu/`)
*   **`knowledge_base.py`**: This file contains the `KnowledgeBase` class, an in-memory vector-based knowledge store. It uses embeddings to store and retrieve documents based on semantic similarity. This serves as a practical implementation of some of the core ideas behind TissDB's intended knowledge management capabilities.
*   **`tests/test_knowledge_base.py`**: Unit tests for the `KnowledgeBase` class, providing excellent examples of its usage.

### C++ Utility (`quanta_tissu/knowledge_app/`)
This directory contains a small, standalone C++ application for visualizing graphs in the console. It is not the TissDB database itself, but rather a utility that could be used to display the graph-based data structures mentioned in the TissDB vision.
*   `graph_logic.h` & `graph_logic.cpp`: Define and implement the `GraphLogic` class.
*   `main.cpp`: The entry point for the C++ application.

# TissDB Improvements Guide

This document outlines the key areas where the TissDB engine is planned to be improved. The current implementation provides a solid foundation, but the enhancements detailed in the official **[TissDB Roadmap](tissdb_roadmap.md)** are crucial for making it a robust, scalable, and production-ready database system.

The improvements are organized by the development phases in which they are planned to be addressed.

## 1. Immediate Future (Phase 2 Completions)

This set of improvements focuses on rounding out the feature set of the single-node database, particularly in the areas of querying and data integrity.

*   **Compound Indexing**: The query engine will be enhanced to support creating indexes on multiple fields. This is critical for optimizing queries that filter on several attributes simultaneously (e.g., `WHERE brand = 'A' AND price < 100`).
*   **TissQL Aggregate Functions**: The query language will be expanded to include standard SQL aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`) and the `GROUP BY` clause. This enables basic analytical queries to be run directly in the database.
*   **Multi-Document Transactions**: Full ACID transaction support will be implemented across multiple documents. This will be managed via `begin`, `commit`, and `rollback` API endpoints and will be crucial for any application requiring atomicity for complex operations.

## 2. Mid-Term Enhancements (Phase 3 - Distributed System)

This phase represents a major architectural leap, transforming TissDB from a single-node database into a distributed, scalable, and secure system.

*   **Leader-Follower Replication**: To ensure high availability and data durability, a leader-follower replication strategy will be implemented using a consensus algorithm like Raft.
*   **Range-Based Sharding**: To enable horizontal scalability, TissDB will support sharding, allowing a single collection's data to be partitioned and distributed across multiple nodes.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A comprehensive security model will be introduced, allowing administrators to define roles with granular permissions (e.g., `read`, `write`) on a per-collection basis.
*   **Official Client Libraries**: To improve developer experience, official, idiomatic client libraries for Python and JavaScript will be developed and published to their respective package managers.
*   **Encryption at Rest**: The storage engine will be modified to encrypt all data files on disk (segment files, indexes, and WAL), with keys managed by an external system.

## 3. Long-Term Goals (Phase 4+ - Production & Relational)

These improvements focus on making TissDB a production-ready, operationally mature system, and expanding its capabilities to handle relational workloads.

### Production Readiness
*   **Robust Monitoring and Alerting**: Integration with industry-standard monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus) to expose key metrics on performance, throughput, and resource usage.
*   **Advanced Configuration Management**: Externalizing all configurable parameters to allow for easy management across different deployment environments.
*   **Deployment and Operations**: Providing official Docker images and Kubernetes manifests to simplify deployment, scaling, and troubleshooting.
*   **Security Hardening**: Conducting security audits, penetration testing, and hardening all system components against vulnerabilities.

### Relational Completeness
*   **Schema Definition and Enforcement**: Implementing a full Data Definition Language (DDL) to define and enforce table schemas, including data types and constraints (primary keys, foreign keys).
*   **Full SQL Support**: Extending the TissQL parser and engine to support a significant subset of SQL, including multi-table `JOIN` operations, subqueries, and `HAVING` clauses.
*   **Full ACID Compliance for Relational Workloads**: Implementing true multi-statement, multi-row ACID transactions with strict isolation levels suitable for relational data.

## 4. Conceptual Features (Beyond the Core Roadmap)

This section lists innovative features envisioned for the TissDB ecosystem that are not yet part of the formal development plan.

*   **Change Data Capture (CDC) Streams**: The ability for client applications to subscribe to a real-time feed of all data changes in a collection.
*   **Webhooks**: A push-based notification system where TissDB can call an external URL when a specific data event occurs.
*   **Materialized Views**: The ability to pre-compute and store the results of complex queries to accelerate analytics and reporting.
*   **TissDB Business Intelligence Suite**: A native BI suite, including a Query Workbench and a Dashboard Builder, designed to leverage the unique capabilities of TissDB.

# TissDB Integration Guide

## 1. Introduction

TissDB is a purpose-built database designed to serve as a high-performance, flexible data backbone for the Quanta ecosystem. Its primary goal is to reduce data silos, simplify inter-service communication, and accelerate development cycles by providing a unified, API-first data layer.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to integrate your service with TissDB, covering everything from basic connections to advanced data synchronization and governance strategies.

## 2. Core Integration Concepts

### Key Features
*   **Hybrid Data Storage:** TissDB natively handles both structured, document-style data (e.g., XML/JSON) and tabular data, allowing services to use the best format for the job within the same database.
*   **Graph-Powered TissQL Queries:** All data interactions are handled through TissQL, a powerful query language. The query engine is built on algorithms that treat all data as nodes in a conceptual graph network, allowing for expressive queries that can traverse relationships between disparate data sources seamlessly.
*   **API-First Design:** All database features are exposed through a clean, well-documented RESTful API, making it easy for services written in any language to connect and interact with the database. For details, see the **[TissDB API Guide](tissdb_api_guide.md)**.

### TissQL by Example
TissQL allows services to access data without needing direct API dependencies on each other.

*   **Example 1: Basic Query**
    ```json
    { "query": "SELECT preferences FROM users WHERE id = '12345'" }
    ```
*   **Example 2: Cross-Collection Join**
    ```json
    { "query": "SELECT T2.product_name, COUNT(T2.product_name) as views FROM users T1 JOIN view_events T2 ON T1.id = T2.user_id WHERE T1.id = '12345' GROUP BY T2.product_name" }
    ```

## 3. Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide

This section provides a practical walkthrough for integrating a new service with TissDB.

### Step 1: Define Your Data Contract
Before writing code, identify the structure of the data your service will read or write. For example, an `inventory-service` might define a `product` document like this:
```json
{
  "sku": "HD-WIDGET-01",
  "stock_level": 150,
  "warehouse_location": "Aisle 4, Bay 2",
  "last_updated": "2023-11-05T14:30:00Z"
}
```

### Step 2: Implement an API Client
Your service will need a client to communicate with the TissDB REST API. Here is a basic example in Python:
```python
import requests
import json

TISSDB_URL = "http://tissdb.internal:8080"
API_KEY = "your-secure-api-key" # See Security section

def create_product(product_data):
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
    response = requests.post(f"{TISSDB_URL}/inventory", headers=headers, data=json.dumps(product_data))
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()

def find_low_stock_products(threshold):
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
    query = f"SELECT sku, stock_level FROM inventory WHERE stock_level < {threshold}"
    response = requests.post(f"{TISSDB_URL}/inventory/_query", headers=headers, json={"query": query})
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()
```

### Step 3: Handle API Responses and Errors
Be prepared to handle standard HTTP status codes:
-   `200 OK`: Successful `GET` or `_query`.
-   `201 Created`: Successful `POST`.
-   `400 Bad Request`: Your request or query is malformed.
-   `401 Unauthorized`: Your API key is missing or invalid.
-   `404 Not Found`: The resource does not exist.
-   `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on the TissDB server.

### Step 4: Follow Performance Best Practices
*   **Use Indexes**: For any field used in a `WHERE` clause, ensure an index is created. Querying non-indexed fields will result in a slow full collection scan.
*   **Be Specific with Projections**: Always specify the exact fields you need in a `SELECT` statement (e.g., `SELECT sku, stock_level` instead of `SELECT *`).
*   **Batch Your Operations**: When creating or updating many documents, use the bulk endpoints instead of sending hundreds of individual requests.
*   **Cache Frequently Accessed Data**: Implement a client-side caching layer for static or slowly changing data.

## 4. Advanced Integration Patterns

### Asynchronous Communication
*   **Shared Data Hub**: Two or more services communicate asynchronously by reading and writing to a shared collection. For example, a `payment-service` writes a `payment_receipt` document, which an `email-service` then reads to send a confirmation. This decouples the services.

### Data Synchronization Strategies
For complex systems requiring active data synchronization, TissDB supports several patterns:
*   **Change Data Capture (CDC) Streams**: The most robust method. Services can subscribe to a dedicated change stream for a collection (e.g., `GET /inventory/_changes`) and receive every CUD event in real-time.
*   **Webhooks**: A simpler, push-based alternative. A service registers a webhook URL with TissDB. When a specified event occurs, TissDB sends an HTTP POST to the URL with the event payload.
*   **Batch Synchronization**: A service runs a scheduled job that executes a TissQL query to pull data modified since the last run, typically using a timestamp field.

## 5. Data Governance and Security

### Data Governance and Schema Management
While TissDB is schema-flexible, establishing clear data contracts is crucial in a multi-service environment.
*   **Shared Schema Repository**: It is highly recommended to maintain a central, version-controlled repository (e.g., a Git repo) that holds the canonical schemas for all shared data collections.
*   **Schema Evolution Strategy**: To evolve data structures without breaking consumers, prefer additive changes (only adding new, optional fields). For breaking changes, include a `schema_version` field in your documents to allow consumers to handle different versions gracefully.

### Security and Authentication
All communication with TissDB must be secured.
*   **Encryption in Transit**: The API requires TLS 1.2+ for all connections.
*   **Authentication**: Services must authenticate using a bearer token (API Key) in the `Authorization` header of every request.
*   **Authorization**: Access is controlled via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Roles are defined with granular permissions (e.g., `read`, `write`) on a per-collection basis.

## 6. Operational Concerns

### Monitoring and Observability
TissDB provides a Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint at `GET /metrics`. This endpoint exposes real-time data on query performance, throughput, error rates, and resource usage. TissDB also outputs structured JSON logs for easy ingestion into log management systems.

### Backup and Recovery
TissDB provides an administrative API endpoint (`POST /_admin/snapshots`) to trigger online snapshots, which create a consistent, point-in-time view of the database without downtime. It is recommended to automate this process and store snapshots in a secure, off-site location.

### API Versioning
The TissDB API will be versioned via the URL path (e.g., `/api/v1/users`). Non-breaking changes (like adding a new field to a response) will not change the version. Breaking changes will only be introduced in a new API version, and older versions will be maintained for a reasonable deprecation period.

## 7. Analytics and Business Intelligence

TissDB is designed with powerful features to support analytical queries directly on your operational data.

### Advanced Analytical Queries
TissQL supports aggregations, joins, and window functions, reducing the need to move large amounts of data to a separate analytics system.
*   **Example Window Function (7-Day Moving Average)**:
    ```json
    {
      "query": "SELECT sale_date, total_sales, AVG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_avg FROM daily_sales"
    }
    ```

### Materialized Views
For frequently run, complex analytical queries, TissDB supports **materialized views**, which pre-compute and store the result of a query for near-instantaneous access.

### Integration with BI Tools
TissDB is designed to integrate with standard BI tools like Tableau or Power BI via a dedicated JDBC/ODBC connector (planned for a future release).

## 8. Conclusion

The development of TissDB is a strategic investment in our engineering ecosystem. By providing a flexible, powerful, and centralized data integration point, TissDB will break down data barriers, reduce architectural complexity, and empower our development teams to build more cohesive and capable applications.





# TissDB Phase I Issues

This document lists the issues and areas for improvement identified in the TissDB codebase during the Phase I review.

## 1. Outdated `README.md`

The `tissdb/README.md` file is outdated. It incorrectly states that the database does not support collections, but the `tissdb/storage/lsm_tree.h` header file clearly defines an interface for creating, deleting, and listing collections. The README should be updated to reflect the current state of the codebase.

## 2. B-Tree Licensing

The B-Tree implementation is sourced from a third-party GitHub repository (`SirLYC/BPTree`) that does not have a license. This poses a significant legal risk for the project. For any production use, this should be replaced with a B-Tree implementation that has a clear and compatible open-source license.

## 3. Inefficient B-Tree Serialization

The current B-Tree implementation uses a temporary file on disk for serialization and deserialization. This approach is inefficient and can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially with large datasets. It also introduces a potential point of failure if the temporary file cannot be created or written to. A more direct and efficient serialization mechanism should be implemented.

## 4. In-Memory B-Tree

The B-Tree implementation is not truly persistent. While it can be loaded from and saved to a file, it is not integrated with the database's storage engine in a way that ensures durability and consistency. The B-Tree should be made fully persistent and integrated with the LSM-Tree storage engine.

## 5. No Graceful Shutdown

The TissDB server does not handle signals (e.g., `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`). This means that if the server is terminated with Ctrl+C, it will not have a chance to shut down gracefully. This can lead to data corruption or resource leaks. Proper signal handling should be implemented to ensure a clean shutdown.

## 6. Manual Parser

The TissQL parser is hand-written, which makes it complex and potentially difficult to maintain. Using a parser generator tool like ANTLR or Bison would make the parser more robust, easier to extend, and less prone to bugs.

## 7. Limited Error Recovery in Parser

The current parser may not provide clear and helpful error messages when it encounters a syntax error in a query. This can make it difficult for users to debug their queries. The parser should be improved to provide better error reporting and recovery.

## 8. Limited SQL Support

The TissQL query language currently supports only a basic subset of SQL. It lacks important features like `JOIN` operations, subqueries, and other advanced functionalities. While this may be acceptable for a simple database, adding support for more SQL features would greatly enhance its capabilities.

## 9. No Transactions

The database does not support transactions. This is a major limitation, as transactions are essential for ensuring data consistency in many applications. Implementing ACID-compliant transactions should be a high priority.

## 10. No Replication or Sharding

TissDB does not have any built-in support for replication or sharding. This limits its scalability and fault tolerance. For the database to be used in a production environment, it would need to support replication for high availability and sharding for horizontal scaling.



# TissDB Remaining Implementation Items

This document outlines the remaining features and tasks to be implemented for TissDB, based on the official development plan and task list.

## Phase 2: V1.1 Enhancements

The following features from Phase 2 are not yet implemented:

-   **Task 2.4: Compound Indexing**
    -   **Description**: Update the indexing mechanism to support indexes on multiple fields (e.g., `(field_a, field_b)`). This requires modifying the B-Tree to handle composite keys and enhancing the query planner to use these indexes.
    -   **Status**: Not Started

-   **Task 2.5: TissQL Aggregate Functions**
    -   **Description**: Extend TissQL to support aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and the `GROUP BY` clause. This involves implementing an aggregation operator in the query executor.
    -   **Status**: Not Started

-   **Task 2.6: Multi-Document Transactions**
    -   **Description**: Implement ACID transactions for operations spanning multiple documents. This requires a transaction manager, a concurrency control mechanism (e.g., two-phase locking), and API endpoints for transaction control (`/begin`, `/commit`, `/rollback`).
    -   **Status**: Not Started

## Phase 3: V2.0 - Distributed Features

This phase focuses on transforming TissDB into a distributed, scalable, and secure system. All tasks in this phase are pending.

### Long-Term Conceptual Vision

The `tissdb_vision.md` document describes a conceptual future for TissDB based on "TissLang" principles, where the database would function like a biological organism. Key concepts include:

-   **Cellular Data Atoms**: Data as self-contained, immutable "cells" with their own logic.
-   **Inter-Cellular Adhesion**: Graph-like connections between cells.
-   **Homeostasis and Adaptation**: A self-healing and evolving data structure.

This vision represents a more speculative, long-term direction for the project and is not part of the immediate, concrete development plan.

# QuantaTissu Agentic Development Roadmap

This document outlines a strategic roadmap for evolving QuantaTissu from a foundational language model into a sophisticated, agentic coding assistant capable of understanding, planning, and executing complex software development tasks.

## Introduction

The goal is to transform QuantaTissu into an autonomous agent that can interact with a development environment to write, debug, and test code. This requires augmenting the core language model with capabilities for reasoning, tool use, and self-correction. This evolution will proceed in two major phases: enhancing the foundational model and then building agentic capabilities on top of it.

## Phase 1: Foundational Model Enhancement

Before QuantaTissu can function as an agent, its core language model must be powerful, robust, and specialized for code. The focus of this phase is to elevate the model from a toy project to a capable code LLM.

### 1.1. Implement a Full-Scale Training Pipeline
-   **Objective**: Build the infrastructure to train QuantaTissu on a large-scale dataset.
-   **Key Actions**:
    -   Implement backpropagation to enable gradient-based learning.
    -   Integrate a modern optimizer like AdamW.
    -   Develop a data loading and preprocessing pipeline for handling massive code datasets (e.g., The Stack).
    -   Implement a robust training loop with support for checkpointing, logging, and metrics tracking.

### 1.2. Upgrade Model Architecture and Tokenization
-   **Objective**: Modernize the model architecture for better performance and scalability.
-   **Key Actions**:
    -   **Scale Up**: Increase model depth (more transformer blocks) and width (`d_model`) significantly.
    -   **Tokenizer**: Replace the basic word-level tokenizer with a **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)** tokenizer trained on a large code corpus. This is critical for handling the vast and complex vocabulary of programming languages.
    -   **Efficiency**: Implement **KV Caching** and other optimizations to ensure efficient inference, which is crucial for an interactive agent.

### 1.3. Establish Rigorous Evaluation
-   **Objective**: Develop a framework for measuring the model's coding capabilities.
-   **Key Actions**:
    -   Implement standard code generation benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval, MBPP).
    -   Set up an evaluation suite to continuously track performance on tasks like code completion, bug fixing, and test generation.

## Phase 2: Developing Agentic Capabilities

With a strong foundation, the next step is to build the agentic framework that allows the model to act.

### 2.1. Tool Integration (Tool-Use)
-   **Objective**: Enable the model to interact with a developer's environment.
-   **Key Actions**:
    -   **Develop a Tool API**: Create a simple, robust interface that allows the model to issue commands.
    -   **Implement Core Tools**:
        -   `read_file(path)`: To read existing code.
        -   `write_file(path, content)`: To create or modify files.
        -   `run_shell(command)`: To execute shell commands for compilation, running tests, etc.
    -   **Fine-tuning for Tool Use**: Fine-tune the model on examples of "thinking" and "tool invocation" to teach it how to request actions.

### 2.2. Planning and Reasoning Engine
-   **Objective**: Give the model the ability to break down high-level goals into executable steps.
-   **Key Actions**:
    -   **Implement a Planning Module**: Start with simple prompting techniques like **Chain of Thought (CoT)** where the model "thinks out loud" to structure its plan.
    -   **Advanced Planning**: Explore more complex strategies like **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)**, allowing the model to explore multiple plans and self-correct.
    -   **State Management**: Develop a system for the agent to maintain an understanding of its current state (files open, recent actions, etc.).

### 2.3. Feedback and Self-Correction Loop
-   **Objective**: Create a mechanism for the agent to learn from its mistakes in real-time.
-   **Key Actions**:
    -   **Output Parsing**: Implement parsers to capture the output of tools (e.g., compiler errors, test failures).
    -   **Self-Correction Prompting**: Develop prompts that feed back the error messages to the model and ask it to generate a fix. For example: "Your previous code failed with the following error: `[error message]`. Please analyze the error and provide a corrected version of the file."

## Key Challenges and Mitigations

| Challenge | Mitigation Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Computational Resources** | **Start Small**: Begin with smaller-scale models to iterate quickly.<br>**Efficient Training**: Explore techniques like LoRA for fine-tuning.<br>**Cloud Resources**: Utilize cloud platforms for scalable training. |
| **High-Quality Code Data** | **Curated Datasets**: Focus on high-quality, well-documented code repositories.<br>**Data Cleaning**: Implement aggressive filtering and cleaning pipelines.<br>**Synthetic Data**: Generate synthetic examples of planning and tool use. |
| **Safety and Reliability** | **Sandboxing**: Run the agent in a secure, containerized environment to prevent unintended side effects.<br>**User Confirmation**: Require user approval for potentially destructive actions (e.g., deleting files, running risky commands).<br>**Limited Permissions**: Grant the agent minimal necessary permissions. |
| **Scalability** | **Incremental Development**: Start with narrow, well-defined tasks (e.g., "fix this specific linting error") before tackling open-ended problems.<br>**Modular Design**: Keep the agent's components (planning, execution, memory) modular and independently improvable. |

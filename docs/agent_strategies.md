# QuantaTissu Agentic Development Strategy

This document outlines the strategic vision to evolve QuantaTissu from a foundational language model into a fully agentic coding assistant—one capable of autonomously understanding, planning, and executing complex software development tasks.

## The Vision: A Self-Directed Software Engineer

The long-term vision is to transform QuantaTissu into a system that can interpret high-level goals, interact with development tools, and iteratively refine its own output through reasoning and feedback.

Achieving this requires a two-pronged strategy:
1.  **Build a robust, code-specialized foundational model.**
2.  **Layer agentic capabilities on top**, including tool use, planning, and self-correction.

## Strategy 1: Enhance the Foundational Model

Before QuantaTissu can *act*, it must first *understand*. This part of the strategy focuses on ensuring the model can generate high-quality code reliably.

### Key Pillars:
-   **Full-Scale Training Pipeline**: Establish a scalable, production-grade training system capable of handling massive code datasets.
-   **Modern Architecture**: Upgrade the model for scale and efficiency with features like advanced tokenization (BPE) and inference optimizations (KV Caching, Flash Attention).
-   **Rigorous Evaluation**: Quantify and track the model’s coding proficiency using standard benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP.

*For detailed progress and next steps, see the **[Project Roadmap](roadmap.md)**.*

## Strategy 2: Develop Agentic Capabilities

Once the model understands code, it must learn to act. This involves building the scaffolding that enables QuantaTissu to interact with tools, reason through tasks, and self-correct.

### Key Pillars:

#### 2.1. Tool Integration (Tool-Use)
**Goal**: Allow the model to interact with a developer’s environment via a secure and extensible API.
**Implementation**: This is achieved through **TissLang**, which provides commands like `read_file`, `write_file`, and `run_shell`. The model is fine-tuned to generate TissLang scripts to invoke these tools.

#### 2.2. Planning and Reasoning Engine
**Goal**: Enable the model to decompose high-level goals into actionable steps.
**Implementation**: This is the core function of **TissLang**. The agent generates a TissLang script as its "plan," which can be reviewed and executed. This approach evolves from simple sequential plans to more complex ones involving logic and sub-tasks.

#### 2.3. Feedback and Self-Correction Loop
**Goal**: Teach the agent to learn from its own mistakes in real-time.
**Implementation**: The TissLang execution engine is designed to capture outputs from commands, including compiler errors and test failures. A failed `ASSERT` statement triggers a feedback loop where the error message is provided back to the agent, prompting it to generate a corrected TissLang script.

### Key Challenges and Mitigations

| Challenge | Mitigation Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Computational Resources** | Start with small models for rapid iteration.<br>Use LoRA or QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning.<br>Leverage cloud platforms for scalable training. |
| **High-Quality Code Data** | Curate datasets from trusted repositories.<br>Apply aggressive filtering and deduplication.<br>Generate synthetic examples for tool use and planning. |
| **Safety and Reliability** | Run agents in sandboxed containers.<br>Require user confirmation for risky actions (Human-in-the-Loop).<br>Limit permissions to prevent unintended side effects. |
| **Scalability** | Begin with narrow tasks (e.g., linting fixes).<br>Design modular components for planning, execution, and memory.<br>Enable independent upgrades to each subsystem. |

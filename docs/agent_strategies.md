# QuantaTissu Agentic Development Roadmap
This roadmap outlines a strategic plan to evolve QuantaTissu from a foundational language model into a fully agentic coding assistant ‚Äî one capable of autonomously understanding, planning, and executing complex software development tasks in real-world environments.

## Introduction
The long-term vision is to transform QuantaTissu into a self-directed software engineer: a system that can interpret high-level goals, interact with development tools, and iteratively refine its own output through reasoning and feedback. Achieving this requires a two-phase approach:
- Phase 1: Build a robust, code-specialized foundational model.
- Phase 2: Layer agentic capabilities on top ‚Äî including tool use, planning, and self-correction.

## Phase 1: Foundational Model Enhancement
Before QuantaTissu can act, it must first understand. This phase focuses on upgrading the model‚Äôs core architecture, training infrastructure, and evaluation framework to ensure it can generate high-quality code reliably.

### 1.1. Implement a Full-Scale Training Pipeline
**Goal:** Establish a scalable, production-grade training system.

**Key Actions:**
-   Implement backpropagation and gradient-based learning for model optimization.
-   Integrate AdamW or similar optimizers for stable convergence.
-   Build a data ingestion pipeline capable of handling massive code datasets (e.g., The Stack, CodeSearchNet).
-   Design a training loop with:
    -   Checkpointing for fault tolerance
    -   Logging for traceability
    -   Metrics tracking (loss, accuracy, perplexity) for performance monitoring

### 1.2. Upgrade Model Architecture and Tokenization
**Goal:** Modernize the model for scale, efficiency, and code-specific understanding.

**Key Actions:**
-   **Scale Up:** Increase depth (transformer layers) and width (d_model) to support richer representations.
-   **Tokenizer Overhaul:**
    -   Replace word-level tokenization with Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or Unigram LM.
    -   Train tokenizer on multilingual code corpora to handle syntax diversity.
-   **Inference Optimizations:**
    -   Implement KV Caching for faster autoregressive decoding.
    -   Explore FlashAttention, quantization, and model parallelism for deployment efficiency.

### 1.3. Establish Rigorous Evaluation
**Goal:** Quantify and track the model‚Äôs coding proficiency.

**Key Actions:**
-   Integrate standard benchmarks:
    -   HumanEval for code generation
    -   MBPP for multi-step programming tasks
-   Build a custom evaluation suite for:
    -   Code completion
    -   Bug fixing
    -   Unit test generation
    -   Refactoring and documentation synthesis

## Phase 2: Developing Agentic Capabilities
Once the model understands code, it must learn to act. This phase introduces the agentic scaffolding that enables QuantaTissu to interact with tools, reason through tasks, and self-correct.
üõ†Ô∏è 2.1. Tool Integration (Tool-Use)
Goal: Allow the model to interact with a developer‚Äôs environment via APIs.
Key Actions:
- Build a Tool API ‚Äî a secure, extensible interface for issuing commands.
- Implement core tools:
- read_file(path): Load source code
- write_file(path, content): Modify or create files
- run_shell(command): Compile, test, or execute code
- Fine-tune the model on examples of tool invocation, teaching it to request actions contextually and responsibly.
üß© 2.2. Planning and Reasoning Engine
Goal: Enable the model to decompose goals into actionable steps.
Key Actions:
- Start with Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting:
- Encourage the model to ‚Äúthink aloud‚Äù and structure its approach.
- Advance to Tree of Thoughts (ToT):
- Let the model explore multiple solution paths, evaluate them, and choose the best.
- Implement State Management:
- Track open files, recent actions, and current objectives.
- Maintain a working memory for multi-step tasks.
üîÑ 2.3. Feedback and Self-Correction Loop
Goal: Teach the agent to learn from its own mistakes in real-time.
Key Actions:
- Build output parsers for:
- Compiler errors
- Test failures
- Runtime exceptions
- Design self-correction prompts:
- Feed error messages back into the model
- Ask it to analyze, explain, and revise its code
- Example:
Your previous code failed with the following error: `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s)`.  
Please analyze the error and provide a corrected version of the file.

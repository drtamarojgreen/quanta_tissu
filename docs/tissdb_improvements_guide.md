# TissDB Improvements Guide

This document outlines key areas where the TissDB engine can be improved. The current implementation provides a basic foundation, but enhancements in the following areas are crucial for making it a robust and production-ready database system.

## 1. Documentation

**Problem:** Implementation-level comments are limited. Understanding the exact query behaviors or the nuances of the storage mechanics currently requires a deep dive into the source code.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Add detailed comments to public APIs and complex internal functions.
- Create comprehensive developer documentation explaining the architecture, data flow, and storage layout.
- Document the query language and its execution process.

## 2. Performance

**Problem:** The LSM-tree and B-tree implementations are minimal. For large datasets, the engine's performance may not be optimized, leading to slow query responses and high resource consumption.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Implement more sophisticated LSM-tree compaction strategies.
- Optimize the B-tree implementation with better caching and node management.
- Introduce a query optimizer to improve the execution plans for complex queries.
- Benchmark the system and identify performance bottlenecks.

## 3. Concurrency and Transactions

**Problem:** The engine lacks clear support for multi-threaded access, ACID guarantees, or recovery from crashes. This limits its use in applications requiring concurrent operations and data integrity.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Implement a locking mechanism (e.g., MVCC) to handle concurrent reads and writes safely.
- Introduce transactional support with clear ACID guarantees (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
- Implement a write-ahead log (WAL) for crash recovery and durability.

## 4. Testing

**Problem:** The project has limited automated tests, especially for edge cases, query correctness, and indexing consistency.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Develop a comprehensive test suite covering all components of the database.
- Add unit tests for individual functions and modules.
- Create integration tests that verify the interaction between different parts of the system.
- Implement property-based testing to discover edge cases in the query engine and storage layers.
- Add stress tests to ensure stability under high load.

## 5. Persistence and Scalability

**Problem:** While TissDB persists data to disk, its ability to handle large-scale datasets is untested and likely inefficient.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Design and implement a more robust on-disk format that can scale to terabytes of data.
- Improve memory management to handle large datasets without excessive consumption.
- Explore strategies for horizontal scalability, such as sharding or partitioning.

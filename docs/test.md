# QuantaTissu Test Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for the QuantaTissu application, including unit tests and behavior-driven development (BDD) tests.

## 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests will be written to ensure the correctness of individual components of the application.

### 1.1. Tokenizer

-   `test_tokenize`: Should correctly convert a string of text into a sequence of token IDs.
-   `test_tokenize_unknown_words`: Should handle unknown words by mapping them to the `<unk>` token.
-   `test_detokenize`: Should correctly convert a sequence of token IDs back into a string of text.

### 1.2. Core Components

-   `test_softmax`: Should correctly compute the softmax function for a given input.
-   `test_layer_norm`: Should correctly normalize the output of a layer.
-   `test_scaled_dot_product_attention`: Should compute the correct attention scores and output.
-   `test_multi_head_attention`: Should correctly split and combine heads, and produce the correct output shape.
-   `test_feed_forward`: Should produce the correct output shape.
-   `test_positional_encoding`: Should correctly add positional information to the input embeddings.

### 1.3. Transformer Block

-   `test_transformer_block`: Should produce the correct output shape and not raise any errors.

### 1.4. QuantaTissu Model

-   `test_forward_pass`: Should produce logits of the correct shape.
-   `test_predict`: Should return a single token ID.

## 2. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Tests

BDD tests will be written to ensure that the application behaves as expected from a user's perspective. These tests will be written in a Gherkin-like syntax.

### 2.1. Generating Text

**Feature**: Text Generation
As a user, I want to be able to generate text from a prompt.

**Scenario**: Generate the next word
**Given** a trained QuantaTissu model
**And** a prompt "hello"
**When** I ask the model to predict the next token
**Then** the model should return a single token ID

**Scenario**: Generate a sequence of words
**Given** a trained QuantaTissu model
**And** a prompt "hello world"
**When** I ask the model to generate a sequence of 5 tokens
**Then** the model should return a sequence of 5 token IDs

### 2.2. Handling Unknown Words

**Feature**: Unknown Word Handling
As a user, I want the model to handle words that are not in its vocabulary.

**Scenario**: Tokenize a sentence with an unknown word
**Given** a QuantaTissu model with a fixed vocabulary
**And** a sentence "this is a foobar test"
**When** I tokenize the sentence
**Then** the tokenizer should correctly handle the unknown word

### 2.3. Generating Text with Knowledge Base

**Feature**: Text Generation with Knowledge Base
As a user, I want the model to use a knowledge base to answer my questions.

**Scenario**: Answer a question using the knowledge base
**Given** a QuantaTissu model with a knowledge base
**And** the knowledge base contains the document "the sky is blue"
**When** I ask the model to generate an answer to "what color is the sky" using the knowledge base
**Then** the model should generate an answer containing the word "blue"

### 2.4. TissDB Document Management

**Feature**: TissDB Document Management
As a user, I want to be able to manage documents in TissDB.

**Scenario**: Create a new document
**Given** a running TissDB instance
**When** I send a POST request to "/documents" with the following JSON:
"""
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30
}
"""
**Then** the response should have a status code of 201
**And** the response should contain a JSON object with the created document's ID

**Scenario**: Retrieve an existing document
**Given** a document with ID "1234" exists in TissDB
**When** I send a GET request to "/documents/1234"
**Then** the response should have a status code of 200
**And** the response should contain a JSON object with the document's data

**Scenario**: Update an existing document
**Given** a document with ID "1234" exists in TissDB
**When** I send a PUT request to "/documents/1234" with the following JSON:
"""
{
  "age": 31
}
"""
**Then** the response should have a status code of 200
**And** the response should contain a JSON object with the updated document's data

**Scenario**: Delete an existing document
**Given** a document with ID "1234" exists in TissDB
**When** I send a DELETE request to "/documents/1234"
**Then** the response should have a status code of 204

### 2.5. Tissu Sinew C++ Connector

**Feature**: Tissu Sinew C++ Connector
As a C++ developer, I want to reliably connect to TissDB.

**Scenario**: Successfully connect and run a PING command
**Given** a TissDB server running on "127.0.0.1" at port 8080
**When** I use the C++ connector to run the "PING" command
**Then** the connector should successfully return "PONG"

**Scenario**: Fail to connect to a non-existent server
**Given** no TissDB server is running on "127.0.0.1" at port 8081
**When** I attempt to use the C++ connector to run a "PING" command on port 8081
**Then** the connector should fail with a connection error

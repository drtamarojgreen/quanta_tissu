# QuantaTissu Test Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for the QuantaTissu application, including unit tests and behavior-driven development (BDD) tests.

## 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests will be written to ensure the correctness of individual components of the application.

### 1.1. Tokenizer

-   `test_tokenize`: Should correctly convert a string of text into a sequence of token IDs.
-   `test_tokenize_unknown_words`: Should handle unknown words by mapping them to the `<unk>` token.
-   `test_detokenize`: Should correctly convert a sequence of token IDs back into a string of text.

### 1.2. Core Components

-   `test_softmax`: Should correctly compute the softmax function for a given input.
-   `test_layer_norm`: Should correctly normalize the output of a layer.
-   `test_scaled_dot_product_attention`: Should compute the correct attention scores and output.
-   `test_multi_head_attention`: Should correctly split and combine heads, and produce the correct output shape.
-   `test_feed_forward`: Should produce the correct output shape.
-   `test_positional_encoding`: Should correctly add positional information to the input embeddings.

### 1.3. Transformer Block

-   `test_transformer_block`: Should produce the correct output shape and not raise any errors.

### 1.4. QuantaTissu Model

-   `test_forward_pass`: Should produce logits of the correct shape.
-   `test_predict`: Should return a single token ID.

## 2. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Tests

BDD tests will be written to ensure that the application behaves as expected from a user's perspective. These tests will be written in a Gherkin-like syntax.

### 2.1. Generating Text

**Feature**: Text Generation
As a user, I want to be able to generate text from a prompt.

**Scenario**: Generate the next word
**Given** a trained QuantaTissu model
**And** a prompt "hello"
**When** I ask the model to predict the next token
**Then** the model should return a single token ID

**Scenario**: Generate a sequence of words
**Given** a trained QuantaTissu model
**And** a prompt "hello world"
**When** I ask the model to generate a sequence of 5 tokens
**Then** the model should return a sequence of 5 token IDs

### 2.2. Handling Unknown Words

**Feature**: Unknown Word Handling
As a user, I want the model to handle words that are not in its vocabulary.

**Scenario**: Tokenize a sentence with an unknown word
**Given** a QuantaTissu model with a fixed vocabulary
**And** a sentence "this is a foobar test"
**When** I tokenize the sentence
**Then** the token "foobar" should be mapped to the `<unk>` token ID.

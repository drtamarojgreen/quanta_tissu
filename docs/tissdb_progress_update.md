# TissDB Progress Update - Q3 2025

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides an updated status report on the TissDB project, superseding the previous `tissdb_current_status.md`.

Contrary to the prior status document, the C++ NoSQL database at the core of the TissDB plan is **well into its implementation phase**. A significant portion of the planned features for Phase 1 (MVP) and Phase 2 (V1.1) have been implemented and are present in the `tissdb/` codebase. The `tissdb_tasklist.md` provides a more accurate, albeit granular, view of the project's true status.

This update synthesizes findings from a direct review of the C++ source code to provide a clear, high-level overview of what has been built.

## 2. Implemented Core Features (as of August 2025)

The TissDB server is a functional C++ application that can be compiled and run. It exposes a RESTful API to interact with a persistent, single-node database engine. The following major components have been implemented:

### Core Database Engine (`tissdb/storage/`)

*   **LSM-Tree Storage**: A Log-Structured Merge-Tree engine forms the foundation, providing efficient write performance. This includes an in-memory `memtable`, a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for durability, and the flushing of segments to disk.
*   **Collection Management**: The database supports the creation and deletion of named collections to organize documents.
*   **LSM-Tree Compaction**: A background process for merging segment files to reclaim space from deleted/updated documents is in place.
*   **Persistent B-Tree Indexing**: The engine supports creating indexes on document fields to accelerate queries.
    *   **Compound Indexing**: Indexes can be created on multiple fields simultaneously.
*   **Basic Transaction Support**: The engine has an internal transaction manager, with functionality for beginning, committing, and rolling back transactions exposed via the API.

### RESTful API (`tissdb/api/`)

A comprehensive HTTP API provides access to the database's features:

*   **Full Document CRUD**: Endpoints for `POST` (create), `GET` (read), `PUT` (update), and `DELETE` on documents are functional.
*   **Collection Management API**: Endpoints to `PUT` (create) and `DELETE` collections.
*   **Indexing API**: An endpoint (`POST /<collection>/_index`) allows for the creation of single and compound indexes.
*   **TissQL Query Endpoint**: An endpoint (`POST /<collection>/_query`) accepts queries written in TissQL.

### Query Language (`tissdb/query/`)

*   **TissQL Parser**: A parser for the TissQL language is implemented.
*   **Query Executor**: The executor can process the parsed queries, supporting:
    *   `SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE` clauses.
    *   Index-aware query planning to use B-Tree indexes when available.

## 3. Current Development Focus

While the foundation is strong, several key features from Phase 2 are still in development or require implementation. Based on the task list, the immediate focus is on:

*   **Task 2.4: Compound Indexing**: While the API and storage interfaces exist, robust query planner integration and testing is the next step.
*   **Task 2.5: TissQL Aggregate Functions**: Implementing `COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, etc., along with the `GROUP BY` clause.
*   **Task 2.6: Multi-Document Transactions**: The core API exists, but implementing the underlying concurrency control (e.g., locking) to ensure ACID guarantees is a major work-in-progress.

## 4. Future Roadmap

Beyond the completion of Phase 2, the project roadmap includes:

*   **Phase 3 (V2.0)**: Focus on distributed features, including leader-follower replication (Raft), sharding, and security (RBAC).
*   **Future Phases**: Will explore official client libraries, encryption at rest, and advanced features like CDC streams and materialized views.

This document should be considered the new source of truth for the TissDB project's status. It will be updated as development progresses through the remaining phases.

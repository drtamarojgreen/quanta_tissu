# TissOS Roadmap

This document outlines the design and development roadmap for TissOS, a modern, secure, and high-performance operating system.

## Phase 1: Core Kernel and Infrastructure (Q4 2025 - Q2 2026)

*   **Microkernel Architecture:** Design and implement a robust microkernel focusing on security, isolation, and message-passing.
*   **Memory Management:** Develop a modern memory manager with support for virtual memory, paging, and memory protection.
*   **Process and Thread Scheduler:** Implement a preemptive multitasking scheduler with support for real-time and fair scheduling policies.
*   **Initial Driver Support:** Develop basic drivers for essential hardware, including storage (AHCI), and input devices (PS/2, USB).
*   **Build and Toolchain:** Set up a cross-compilation toolchain and build system for TissOS.

## Phase 2: Core Services and Filesystem (Q3 2026 - Q1 2027)

*   **Filesystem:** Implement a modern, journaled filesystem with support for POSIX semantics.
*   **Networking Stack:** Develop a modular networking stack with support for TCP/IP, UDP, and Ethernet.
*   **System Call Interface:** Define and implement a stable system call interface for user-space applications.
*   **User and Group Management:** Implement a basic user and group management system.
*   **Dynamic Linking and Loading:** Add support for dynamic linking and loading of shared libraries.

## Phase 3: User Interface and Application Ecosystem (Q2 2027 - Q4 2027)

*   **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Design and develop a lightweight and modern GUI compositor and window manager.
*   **Standard C Library:** Port a standard C library (like musl) to TissOS.
*   **Basic Application Suite:** Develop a set of basic applications, including a terminal emulator, text editor, and file manager.
*   **Package Manager:** Create a package manager for installing and managing software on TissOS.
*   **Porting Third-Party Applications:** Begin porting popular open-source applications to TissOS.

## Phase 4: Long-Term Goals and Vision (2028 and beyond)

*   **Hardware Support:** Expand hardware support for a wider range of devices and architectures (e.g., ARM).
*   **Security Enhancements:** Implement advanced security features like sandboxing, mandatory access control, and verified boot.
*   **Virtualization:** Add support for hardware-assisted virtualization.
*   **TissDB Integration:** Deeply integrate TissDB as a core component for system-wide data management.
*   **Developer SDK:** Release a comprehensive SDK for TissOS application development.
